# Curry Fried Crab Recipe

The first time I had curry fried crab was at a Chinese restaurant called Kin Kao in Thailand. The meaty crab was covered in curry sauce with crab roe flavor - absolutely delicious. Programmers who love seafood shouldn't miss this. Simple to make, very friendly for coastal programmers.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Mud crab (also called: meat crab)
- Curry blocks (recommended: Lehui Crab Roe Curry)
- Onion
- Coconut milk
- Egg
- Cornstarch (also called: starch)
- Garlic

## Measurements

Determine how many servings to make before cooking. One serving is enough for 1 person.

Total:
- 1 mud crab (about 300g) * servings
- 15g curry block (one small piece) * servings
- 100ml coconut milk * servings
- 1 egg * servings
- 200g onion * servings
- 5 garlic cloves * servings

## Instructions

- Remove crab shell and cut crab in half. Lightly crack crab claws with back of knife. Dip cut surfaces and claws in cornstarch - not too much. Sprinkle 5g cornstarch into crab shell to cover crab roe, set aside
- Dice onion, set aside
- Mince garlic, set aside
- Boil a kettle of water, set aside
- Heat wok with about 20ml cooking oil, wait 10 seconds for oil to heat up
- Place crab cut-side down into wok, fry for 20 seconds (this seals in crab roe and meat). Flip, fry each side for 10 seconds. Remove crab and set aside
- Put crab shell in wok, use spoon to scoop hot oil and pour over shell to seal in roe, fry for 20 seconds then remove
- Without cleaning wok, add 10ml more oil. Heat until slightly smoking. Add minced garlic and diced onion, stir-fry for 10 seconds
- Add curry block and stir to melt (10 sec), add fried crab and stir evenly
- Add 300ml boiling water, simmer for 3 minutes
- After simmering, add coconut milk and egg white, turn off heat. Keep stirring until sauce thickens
- Serve
