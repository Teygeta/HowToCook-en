## Additional content

Reasons for adding pork belly to red braised carp:

- Pork belly releases pork fat when stir-fried, compared to vegetable oil, animal fat is more fragrant.
- Golden stir-fried pork belly is also delicious after braising, serving as a side dish.
- Fish itself is low in fat, so lacks aroma, focusing more on texture. Therefore it's generally recommended to use pork fat when cooking fish dishes, wanting a milky white fragrant fish soup. Pork fat is the best choice~
