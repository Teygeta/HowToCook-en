# Microwave Scallion Ginger Black Cod Recipe

This dish is adapted from the recipe of Margaret Lu, mother of chef Johnny Zhu from Veil restaurant in Seattle. Ms. Lu's original recipe used tilapia for this dish, Johnny changed it to cod, but halibut fillets, sea bass, trout, etc. can also be used. The density of each fish is different, and the cooking time needs to be adjusted slightly.
