## Calculation

* Ginger slices - cut 2-3 slices from normal old ginger then shred
* Garlic cloves 3-4, crushed or chopped or sliced
* Dried chili peppers (according to personal taste) 2-3, chopped
* Cilantro according to personal taste
* Salt 10g, if chili peppers are very spicy suggest more
* Vinegar 5ml
* Soy sauce 5ml
* White sugar 10g
* Green onions 1-2 stalks, normally just sprinkle chopped green onions
* Thai chili peppers 1-2, can omit, from experience maximum 2 otherwise too spicy
* MSG, according to personal taste, don't use too much, 5g is enough
* Oyster sauce, 5g is enough, same principle as MSG

## Operation

### Ingredient preparation

* Prepare ginger and garlic, chop
* Chop dried chili peppers, mix with ginger and garlic

### Final steps

* Add 30-50ml oil, wait until pan is hot...
* Put in **dried fish** (if you don't want to be splashed by hot oil), then shake pan, fry fish with hot oil, must use low heat during this process
* Flip fish, repeat above frying process
* Add ginger, garlic and chili peppers, stir-fry until fragrant
* Pour in cooking wine, slightly more, be careful during this step as it will create lots of smoke
* Pour in vinegar (can add more if you like vinegar)
* Then add white sugar, soy sauce (dark soy sauce)
* Add cold water, just enough to cover fish body, turn to medium heat, cover with lid, after about 1 minute flip fish, continue covering
* After 3-4 minutes, add salt, Thai chili peppers, oyster sauce (MSG, chicken essence etc), then continue covering, need to flip again later
* When liquid in pan reduces to just below the fish's dorsal fin (or when liquid is almost gone), turn to low heat, add cilantro, green onions, then cover for 20 seconds, turn off heat
* Serve
