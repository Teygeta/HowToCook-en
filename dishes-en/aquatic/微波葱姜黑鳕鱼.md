# Microwave Black Cod with Scallion and Ginger Recipe

This dish is adapted from a recipe by Margaret Lu, mother of Chef Johnny Zhu of Veil Restaurant in Seattle. Ms. Lu's original recipe used tilapia, but Johnny changed it to cod. You can also use halibut fillets, sea bass, or trout. Cooking time should be slightly adjusted for different fish densities.
