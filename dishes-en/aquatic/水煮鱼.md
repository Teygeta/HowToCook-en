## Instructions

- Preparation: If the Basa fillet is taken from the freezer, it needs to be thawed naturally at room temperature for 5 hours before slicing.
- Slicing: Slice the Basa fillet into thin slices, about 5cm long and 3cm wide.
- [Marinating](../../tips/learn/学习腌.md): Place the sliced Basa fillet into a large stainless steel bowl
- Add 30g bean paste, 3g salt, 10ml Sichuan pepper oil, 3g white pepper powder
- Mix well by hand and add 5ml rapeseed oil to seal in the flavor
- Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to marinate.
- Preparing vegetables: Mince the garlic. Taking 300g cauliflower and 200g lettuce as an example, wash the cauliflower and lettuce.
- Blanching and stir-frying: [Blanch the cauliflower in boiling water](../../tips/learn/学习焯水.md) for later use; wash and dry the lettuce, stir-fry for later use (without adding oil).
- Stir-frying bean paste: Heat the wok with cold oil (20ml rapeseed oil), add 10g bean paste, 10g fermented soybeans (optional), add minced garlic, stir-fry slowly over **medium heat**.
- Poaching fish slices: Add 150ml hot water, add the marinated fish slices after the water boils quickly, gently stir to spread the fish slices in the water, add 2g salt and 2g sugar to taste (you can adjust the amount of salt according to personal taste at this time). After the water boils again, it can be served.
- Serving: First put the cooked vegetables into a large bowl, then put the hot fish slices on top of the vegetables, and pour the remaining hot soup from the pot!

## Additional Notes

- The vegetable combination and amount for the base can be freely chosen, but you need to pay attention to the characteristics of various vegetables. For example, when changing to potatoes, you need to cook the potato slices/potato pieces (you can poke them with chopsticks to confirm).
- The amount of red oil bean paste (spiciness) and salt can be adjusted according to personal taste.
- When cutting fish slices, you can first chop the fish into 5cm fish pieces perpendicular to the long strip of the fish, and then turn it 90 degrees and slice it into thin slices diagonally.
- Be careful not to grab too hard when [marinating](../../tips/learn/学习腌.md).
