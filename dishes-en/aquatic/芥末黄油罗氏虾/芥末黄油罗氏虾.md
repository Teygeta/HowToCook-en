* Remember to wait for the shrimp to be fried before taking it out and adding the minced garlic to prevent it from turning black and bitter after frying for too long.
* If you can't accept mustard very well, add less, if you can accept it, add more, if you add too much, cook it for a while, and the mustard flavor will dissipate.
