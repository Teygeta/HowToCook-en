- [Marinate](../../tips/learn/learn to marinate.md): Put the sliced basa fish into a large stainless steel bowl
- Add 30g chili bean paste, 3g salt, 10ml Sichuan pepper oil, 3g white pepper powder
- Mix well by hand then add 5ml rapeseed oil to seal the flavor
- Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to absorb flavors.
- Prepare vegetables: Chop garlic into minced garlic. Take 300g cauliflower, 200g lettuce as example, wash cauliflower and lettuce.
- Blanching and stir-frying vegetables: Blanch cauliflower in boiling water for later use; wash and dry lettuce, stir-fry until cooked for later use (no need to add oil).
- Stir-fry chili bean paste: Heat pan with cold oil (rapeseed oil 20ml), add 10g chili bean paste, 10g fermented black beans (optional), add minced garlic, stir-fry slowly over medium heat.
- Poach fish slices: Add 150ml hot water, when water boils quickly add marinated fish slices, gently stir to let fish slices spread in water, add 2g salt and 2g sugar to taste (can adjust salt amount according to personal taste at this time). When water boils again can serve.

## Additional content

- The combination and amount of bottom vegetables can be freely played with, but need to pay attention to characteristics of various vegetables, for example when changing to potatoes, need to cook potato slices/potato pieces until done (can poke with chopsticks to confirm).
- The amount of chili bean paste (spiciness) and salt can be adjusted according to personal taste.
- When slicing fish, can first chop perpendicular to the long direction of fish slices into 5cm fish pieces, then turn 90 degrees and slice diagonally into thin slices.
- When [marinating](../../tips/learn/learn to marinate.md) don't grab too hard.
