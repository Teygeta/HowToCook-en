## Measurements

* Fish: It is recommended that beginners start with a medium-sized crucian carp, pre-cut with a knife to facilitate cooking (otherwise the back of the fish is prone to being raw)
* Ginger slices: Cut 2-3 slices of normal old ginger, then slice them into shreds
* Garlic cloves: 3-4, smashed or minced or sliced
* Dried chili (according to personal taste): 2-3, chopped
* Coriander: according to personal taste
* Salt: 10g, if the chili is very spicy, it is recommended to add more
* Vinegar: 5ml
* Soy sauce: 5ml
* White sugar: 10g
* Scallions: 1-2, usually sprinkled with chopped green onions
* Small red peppers: 1-2, can be omitted, from the experience of someone who has been there, a maximum of 2, otherwise the spiciness will be too high and you will suffer.
* MSG: according to personal taste, do not add too much, 5g is enough.
* Oyster sauce: 5g is enough, the same reason as MSG

## Instructions

### Raw Material Preparation

* Prepare ginger and garlic, chop them
* Chop the dried chili and put it together with the ginger and garlic

### Final Steps

* Add 30-50ml of oil, wait for the pot to heat up...
* Put in the **wiped dry fish** (if you don’t want to be splattered with hot oil), then shake the pot and fry the fish with hot oil. Pay attention to this process and keep the heat low.
* Turn the fish over and repeat the above oil frying process
* Add ginger, garlic, and chili, stir-fry until fragrant
* Pour in cooking wine, a little more, pay attention to safety during this process, a lot of oily smoke will rise
* Pour in vinegar (you can add more if you like vinegar)
* Then add white sugar and soy sauce (dark soy sauce)
* Add cold water, preferably just enough to submerge the fish, then turn to medium heat, cover the pot, and turn the fish over after about 1 minute, and continue to cover the pot
* After 3-4 minutes, add salt, small red peppers, oyster sauce (MSG, chicken essence, etc.), then continue to cover the pot, and continue to turn over later
* When the soup in the pot is reduced to a little bit below the fins on the back line of the fish (or when there is not much soup), turn to low heat, add coriander and chopped green onions, then cover the pot for 20 seconds, turn off the heat
* Serve
