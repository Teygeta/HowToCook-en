## Measurements

Here, 2 servings are used as an example for arrangement. In the actual operation process, considering that the texture and umami of the fish itself will change with the volume of a single fish, it is recommended that you try to choose 2 servings for the best umami when cooking.

- Mandarin fish = 1 catty (500g)
- Small scallions = 1 (30cm long)
- Small red chili peppers = 2
- Ginger = 50g
- Cooking wine = 25g
- Vegetable oil = 15g
- Salt = 8g
- Steamed fish soy sauce = 10g
- Water = 5L

## Instructions

- Go to the vegetable market to buy fish that has already been processed (it is best not to have internal organs if you process it yourself), and scrape all the scales on the surface of the fish
- Use kitchen paper to wipe the blood and black film on the bones in the fish belly (the blood on the bones will affect the taste, and the black film is the source of the fishy smell)
- Use a kitchen knife to scrape the surface of the fish back and forth several times to scrape off the mucus on the fish and further remove the fishy smell, then rinse the inside and outside of the fish with water
- Place the fish flat on the cutting board, use kitchen paper to dry the water inside and outside the fish, then with the fish head facing left and the tail facing right, start from the side of the fish gills and make a vertical cut every 3cm, the depth reaches the spine of the fish, and use the same treatment on the other side
- Place the fish flat in the basin, making sure there is no excess water in the plate
- Take a piece of 50g ginger (egg size), remove the skin on the surface with a peeling knife and wash it clean, then cut it into 3mm thick ginger slices
- Wash the small red chili peppers, remove the stems, and cut them into small round slices with a thickness of 2mm (or cut them into 1mm wide strips)
- Wash the small scallions, remove the roots, and cut them into 3cm small pieces. For slightly thicker small scallions, you can split them in the middle along the direction of the small scallions.
- Add 8g salt and 25g cooking wine to the basin, put on disposable gloves, and massage the fish for 1 minute to ensure that every part of the fish is evenly coated with salt and cooking wine
- After massaging the fish, stuff a slice of ginger into each incision on the fish, and put 3 slices of ginger in the fish belly, marinate for 10 minutes (it is recommended not to marinate for too long, otherwise the freshness of the fish will be reduced)
- While the fish is marinating, add 5L of water to the steamer, bring to a boil, and place the steamer on the steamer
- After the fish is marinated, it will precipitate water. Pour out the excess water and the cooking wine and ginger slices used for marinating, rinse the fish and fish belly with water, and wipe the fish and fish belly dry with kitchen paper
- Place the fish flat on the steaming fish plate, and re-insert ginger slices into the incisions on the fish and fish belly
- Then put the steaming fish plate into the steamer, cover the lid, and steam over medium heat for 20 minutes
- During this period, water vapor will adhere to the entire fish and plate, and condense to form fish soup. Be sure not to pour out this soup after it comes out of the pot. This soup is the essence of umami
- Use anti-scalding clips to clip out the steaming fish plate, and drizzle 10g of steamed fish soy sauce on the fish and around the fish
- Then sprinkle the scallion sections and small red chili peppers evenly on the fish and around it
- Pour 15g of vegetable oil into the iron pot and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Do not use high heat, otherwise the oil will evaporate quickly
- Pour the hot oil evenly and slowly on the fish after it comes out of the pot, and the scallion oil mandarin fish with fresh eyebrows is out of the pot!

## Additional Notes

After several tests, the success rate is 100%. This dish is very fault-tolerant and can be compatible with people from any province and taste. In addition, although this set of tutorials is called the practice of scallion oil mandarin fish, the raw materials themselves are not limited to mandarin fish, and can be replaced with sea fish such as sea bass and turbot (freshwater fish itself has more parasites than sea fish, so it is not recommended to use freshwater fish. For the practice of freshwater fish, please refer to tutorials such as "Braised Fish"), low coupling and strong scalability.
