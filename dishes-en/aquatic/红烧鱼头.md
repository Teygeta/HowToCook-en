- Oil, salt, chicken essence, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, aged vinegar, black pepper powder, cooking wine

* One fish head
* 200g scallions
* 80g ginger
* 3-4 garlic cloves

## Instructions

### Raw Material Preparation

* Wash the scallions, ginger, garlic, coriander, and small red peppers separately.
* Just rinse the dried chilies and star anise slightly.
* Cut the scallions in half. Cut the back half of the scallions (the white part) into sections, each section about 4cm long. Cut the front half (the green leaves) into sections first, and then split each section into four petals.
* Cut the ginger into slices, each slice about 3mm thick.
* Smash the garlic.
* Take out two sprigs of coriander, remove the roots, and cut into 1.5cm coriander pieces.
* Cut the small red peppers into chili rings with a thickness of 3mm.
* Cut the dried chilies into four sections.

### Marinating the Fish Head

* Note: The fish body mentioned below is the fish meat attached when you buy the fish head.
* Remove the scales from the fish head and clean the uncleaned internal organs at the fish head.
* Chop off the fins and clean the gills.
* Chop off the connection between the fish head chin and the fish body, chop the fish body into pieces, and chop the fish head into four/six pieces.
  * Note: Fish processing is difficult to fully express in words. You can search for fish head processing related videos.
* Wash the chopped fish pieces, preferably washing away the stagnant blood on the fish pieces.
* Put the washed fish pieces into a basin, add 5g salt, 10g light soy sauce, and 10g cooking wine. Add the chopped scallions (the ones chopped in the first half) and 1/3 ginger slices. Mix them well and let them stand for 1-2 hours.
