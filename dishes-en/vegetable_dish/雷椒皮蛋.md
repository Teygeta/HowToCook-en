- Method 1: If you have a rolling pin and smashing things will not disturb the neighbors: use one end of the rolling pin to smash the preserved eggs and green peppers in the small basin until the preserved eggs and green peppers are mixed (optional)
- Method 2: Tear the green peppers by hand, tear them into strips of about half a centimeter, and crush the preserved eggs with a fork (optional)
