## Essential Ingredients and Tools

## Calculation

Determine how many servings you plan to make each time before making. One serving is just enough for 1 person to eat.

Total amount:

* 200 grams of cucumber * number of servings
* 7.5 ml + 4 ml vinegar * number of servings
* 5 ml + 2.5 ml soy sauce * number of servings
* 3 cloves of garlic * number of servings
* 0.4 grams + 0.2 grams of salt * number of servings
* 5 ml + 2 ml sesame oil * number of servings
* 5 ml oyster sauce

## Operation

* Use a kitchen knife to flatten the cucumber and chop it into 3 cm pieces.
* Put the chopped cucumber into a bowl
* Mince the garlic
* Pour vinegar, soy sauce, salt, oyster sauce and garlic into the bowl in order, mix well and marinate for 15 minutes.
* Pour sesame oil into the bowl and mix evenly.

## Additional content

* In some cases, the ends of the cucumber have a bitter taste, please wash and cut them off to confirm.
* Eat it directly after making it, or prepare it first and refrigerate it (not freeze) before eating.
* If refrigerating, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and eat within 8 hours, otherwise the cucumber will lose its crispness due to over-pickling.
* It is recommended to peel the cucumber for a better taste.
