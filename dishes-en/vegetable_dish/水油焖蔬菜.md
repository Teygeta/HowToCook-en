Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Cooking oil
* Salt
* Oyster sauce (optional)
* Leafy vegetables

## Calculation

Leafy vegetables have a high water content and may appear large in volume when preparing. The actual volume will shrink rapidly after being heated.

* Leafy vegetables: 300g ~ 500g

## Operation

* Wash the vegetables
* Add 150ml of water to the pot and bring to a boil. (The water does not need to completely cover the vegetables)
* Add 3g of salt
* (Optional) Add 3ml of oyster sauce
* Add 2ml of cooking oil
* Add the vegetables, stir-fry, then cover the pot and simmer for 1 minute
* Serve

## Additional content

* If you are not sure about the saltiness, you can add less salt first, taste before serving, and consider adjusting the salt.
* You can use chicken soup, bone soup, etc. instead of water, which is more delicious.
* The simmering time should not be too long.
