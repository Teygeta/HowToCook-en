Bingfen, also known as Shiliangfen in some areas, is a famous local snack in Shihe District, Xinyang City, Henan Province, belonging to the Yu cuisine family. This dish is similar to jelly, but because it is made from natural plants, it is healthier than jelly. With mint juice, lemon juice, red beans and other seasonings, it is cool and refreshing. This food is deeply loved by the locals and is suitable for all ages.

The production method is simple, but it is a bit time-consuming, with an estimated production time of 3 hours (including 2.5 hours of standing time for setting).

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Bingfen seeds 200g
- A piece of gauze for filtering soybean residue
- Boiled and cooled water 2000g
- Mint juice 10ml / Mint powder 10g
- Disposable transparent plastic cups (optional)
- Water-activated glowing ice cubes (optional)

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is enough for 5 people.

Per serving:

- Bingfen seeds 200g
- Boiled and cooled water 2000g
- Mint juice 10ml / Mint powder 10g

## Instructions

- Pour the cooled boiled water into a basin;
- Wrap all the bingfen seeds with gauze and tie a knot at the opening
- Put the wrapped bingfen seeds into the cooled boiled water and rub vigorously in the cooled boiled water for 6 minutes
- Then let the cooled boiled water stand for 2.5 hours to set
- Then use a spoon to put the shiliangfen into the prepared disposable transparent plastic cups, add 10ml of mint juice or 10g of mint powder (lemon juice, hawthorn juice, mulberry juice are also acceptable), and then add water-activated glowing ice cubes, and stir slowly with a spoon

## Additional Information

- During operation, pay attention to observe the color and viscosity changes of the cooled boiled water. If the color is too light or the water is not viscous, it means that the amount of bingfen seeds is insufficient, or the rubbing strength and time are not in place.
