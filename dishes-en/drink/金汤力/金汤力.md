## Instructions

### Lemon Preparation

1. Cut the lemon in half (the knife direction should be perpendicular to the line connecting the head and tail of the lemon) and cut a slice from one half for later use.
2. Cut the lemon in half again, and use a juicer to extract the juice from the resulting four lemon quarters into a container for later use.

2. Place 100g of ice cubes at the bottom of the cup.
3. Pour in 30-40ml of gin.
4. Pour in 15ml of lemon juice (add more if you prefer it sour).
5. Stir well with a spoon.
6. Place the prepared lemon slice in the cup.
7. Slowly pour tonic water along the wall of the cup until full (avoid pouring directly onto the ice to prevent losing bubbles).
8. Gently stir the liquid up and down with a spoon (avoid stirring in a circular motion to prevent losing bubbles).
9. Garnish with fresh greens (optional).
