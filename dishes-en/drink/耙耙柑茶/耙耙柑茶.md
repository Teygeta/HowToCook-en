## Instructions

### Jasmine Green Tea Preparation (recommended ratio => tea: water: ice = 1-2: 50: 30):

1. Weigh 2-4g of tea leaves and place them in a container, add 100ml of boiling water, and steep for 6 minutes.
2. Add 60g of ice cubes to the brewed green tea to cool it down, stirring to speed up the cooling process.
3. Once the ice cubes have melted, filter the tea to obtain about 160ml of jasmine green tea.

### Official Mixing:

1. Choose a cup, preferably a transparent glass with a capacity of about 300ml.
2. Remove the segments of the citrus fruit and peel off the skin to obtain the flesh.
3. Place 130g of the flesh and 130ml of jasmine green tea into the blender.
4. Pour in 10g of cane sugar syrup (optional, add more if you prefer it sweeter).
5. Seal the blender and blend for 20 seconds, then pour the mixture into the cup.
6. Tear a bit of the fruit flesh and sprinkle it on the surface of the liquid.

Enjoy!

## Additional Information

- Citrus fruit can be replaced with other citrus fruits that easily separate from the flesh, such as tangerines.
- The ratio of flesh to tea is 1:1; if you need to prepare a larger quantity, you can increase the amounts proportionally.
