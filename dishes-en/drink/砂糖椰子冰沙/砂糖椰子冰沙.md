Estimated cooking difficulty: ★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Ingredients:
- Bottled coconut juice (preferably with a wide mouth)
- Coffee sugar (yellow coarse granules)

### Tools:
- Manual juicer

## Calculation

The best serving size for the slush is usually related to the melting speed. A 300g slush made at -18 degrees Celsius can typically last for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Per serving:

- Bottled coconut juice 500ml
- Coffee sugar 10g (two packets of Taikoo coffee sugar)
- Crushed nuts (optional)

## Instructions

1. Pour out 200ml of the 500ml bottled coconut juice and immediately tighten the cap.
2. Place the bottle of coconut juice in the freezer and freeze for over 10 hours.
3. Take the bottle of coconut juice out. If you confirm that the juice has completely frozen, hit it hard against a hard surface like a wall corner, chair back, or table edge. (Be sure to confirm that the surface will not be damaged.)
4. When the frozen coconut juice turns into a slush state, open the cap and pour out the slush.
5. Evenly sprinkle coffee sugar or crushed nuts on the surface of the slush.
6. Done!

## Additional Information

- During the above steps, the bottled coconut juice can be frozen in advance, but it should not exceed 7 days, otherwise there is a risk of spoilage.
