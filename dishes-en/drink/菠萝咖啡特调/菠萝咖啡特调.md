## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for one person.

Per serving:

- Coffee liquid 30ml
- Pineapple juice 60ml
- Ice cubes 50g
- Soda water 30ml
- Cream 30ml
- Milk 10ml
- Sugar 8g
- Sea salt 0.5g
- Rum 5ml

## Instructions

1. In a cup, add ice cubes, coffee liquid, pineapple juice, and soda water in order.
2. Whip the cream with sugar until soft peaks form, then add rum and milk and mix until smooth.
3. Pour the whipped cream over the mixture in the cup.
4. Sprinkle sea salt on top of the cream.

## Additional Information

- It is recommended to use floral or fruity flavored coffee liquid; for concentrated coffee, medium roast beans can be used, and for cold brew, regular washed or sun-dried beans can be used.
- When pouring the cream, try to keep the height low to allow the cream to float evenly on the surface of the drink, forming a creamy layer.
- Using fresh coffee liquid and pineapple juice can greatly enhance the overall flavor and taste.
