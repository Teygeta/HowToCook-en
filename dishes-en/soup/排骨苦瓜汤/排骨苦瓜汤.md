## Essential Ingredients and Tools

Optional tools

- Electric pressure cooker (can greatly simplify the cooking process and time)
- Casserole (more suitable for stewing soup than a wok)

Required materials

- Ribs
- Bitter melon
- Dried shrimp

## Calculation

You need to determine how many servings you plan to make before each production. One serving is enough for 4 people.
Per serving:

- Ribs 250g to 500g
- Bitter melon 100g to 200g
- Dried shrimp 5g to 15g
- Ginger 5~10g (optional, used to remove fishy smell when blanching)

## Operation

- Wash the ribs and cut them into small pieces of about 4cm ±2cm * 3 ± 2cm (if you don’t have tools for chopping ribs, you can ask the stall owner for help)
- Pour 700ml of cold water into the wok and heat it with the ribs until it boils, turn off the heat and remove the ribs
- Cut the bitter melon in half from the middle, remove the seeds and bitter melon pulp, and cut into 0.5 ± 0.3 cm bitter melon strips, wash clean

  Cooking with a soup pot

  - Pour 1100ml of water and ribs into the soup pot, high heat
  - After the water boils, add the bitter melon and dried shrimp to the pot and turn to low heat, wait for 120~240 minutes (you can take out a piece of meat to taste after 120 minutes. If the meat can be easily separated from the bones, you can turn off the heat)
  - Add salt and white pepper when serving. The recommended amount is 0.3 to 0.6g of salt and 0.1 to 0.5g of white pepper per 250ml

  Cooking with an electric pressure cooker

  - Pour 1000ml of water and ribs, dried shrimp and bitter melon
  - Select the soup stewing function to cook (usually pressure cooking for 45 minutes)
  - Serve, add salt and pepper like a soup pot

## Additional Content

- You can use other ingredients with umami flavor to replace dried shrimp, such as dried scallops
