## Operation

### Mincing the Meat

*   Cut the meat into pieces, with a 3:7 ratio of fat to lean
*   Chop it with a knife, smash it with the back of the knife to loosen the meat fibers
*   Chop and smash until it becomes minced meat. To make it delicious, you have to chop it yourself, the machine-ground meat is too sticky

### Seasoning

*   Per斤 of meat, 6 grams of salt, 1 gram of pepper
*   Mix well by hand
*   Add scallion, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorn water in portions, stirring while adding, knead well by hand to let the meat absorb the water. 80 grams of scallion, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorn water per斤 of minced meat
*   Add the egg white, continue stirring in one direction
*   Add 40 grams of potato starch, mix well
*   Add cooked soybean oil, this is to maintain its tender and elastic state

### Making the Meatballs

*   Bring water to a boil in a pot, then reduce heat to low, so it's barely simmering
*   Use your hand to squeeze out the meatballs
*   Once they all float to the top, cook on low heat for 1 minute

### Making the Meatball Soup
