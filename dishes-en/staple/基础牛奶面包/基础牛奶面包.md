# Basic Milk Bread Recipe

![Finished Milk Bread](./1-1成品.jpg)

Bread is a common staple food. Ordinary bread needs to be fermented and kneaded for a long time. However, this recipe simplifies the production steps as much as possible to make it easier for novices to get started and to ensure its flavor as much as possible. Of course, those with higher requirements can also refer to other bread recipes.

This recipe **requires a lot of extra tools**, which will be introduced in detail in the following chapters.

This recipe is for **baking novices**, the difficulty is **medium**, and the estimated production time is **200 minutes**.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Required Ingredients

- High-gluten or medium-gluten flour * (try to use high-gluten flour, but **avoid using low-gluten flour**. All "all-purpose flour" without special instructions is medium-gluten flour) *
- Eggs * (no excessive requirements for size and weight) *
- Sugar * (It is best to have syrup.) *
- Dry yeast
- Salt
- Milk or light cream or condensed milk or milk powder * (It is best to use **milk powder**, which is full of milky flavor, but **do not use any compound milk powder**, such as adult milk powder or infant milk powder, because the chemical properties are unstable. You can also use a mixture of two kinds of dairy products. Try to **avoid using raw materials with extra sugar**, because the actual sugar content will be more than the amount of sugar recommended in this recipe) *
- Butter or corn oil * (If **the selected dairy product has extremely high fat content, you can skip it**. Try to use unsalted butter with animal fat. Soybean oil may have a beany smell, so try not to use it.) *
- Gluten flour (optional)
- Vanilla extract (optional)

### Necessary Tools

- Oven * ( **Do not use an oven without temperature control** ) *
- Measuring cup
- Cloth
- Rolling pin
- Silicone oil paper or mold

### Optional Materials, Tools, and Introduction of Materials and Tools

> ![Tool 2](./2-2设备简介2.jpg)
> Baking is an independent category of gourmet food production, so it is very different from daily cooking tools. The following introduces commonly used tools.
>
> - ① Measuring cup: Measure raw materials. Measuring cups are generally measured in cup units. Do not shake when measuring to prevent too few raw materials from being measured.
> - ② Scraper: Also known as a silicone spatula, it is used to stir and scrape off batter, etc. attached to the edge of the container.
> - ③ Cloth: Cover the surface of the dough to prevent excessive loss of moisture during the production process. Choose to use a damp or dry cloth depending on the actual situation during the production process. It is recommended to use the drawer cloth of the steamer (not disposable drawer cloth), or you can use plastic wrap.
> - ④ Oven: Bake ingredients. Ovens are divided into small economic ovens and large professional ovens. Economic ovens may be unevenly heated due to poor airtightness, so you can lower the temperature and extend the baking time. The oven must be preheated first. The following chapters will explain in detail.
> - ⑤ Scraper: Scrape off the dough on the panel and cut the dough into appropriate sizes. A clean knife can also be used instead.
> - ⑥ Rolling pin: Press the dough.
> - ⑦ Sprayer: Make the surface of the dough or container evenly covered with water or oil for crispy baking and anti-sticking.
> - ⑧ Sieve: Spread the flour evenly or filter out lumps and impurities in the flour.
> - ⑨ Panel or silicone pad: Perform kneading operations on it to prevent contamination of the dough and other places.
> - ⑩ Brush: Used to brush egg wash on the dough to make the finished product more bright, shiny, and glossy.
> - 11. Silicone oil paper: Prevent adhesion to other items during baking, making it difficult to demold the baked finished product. Silicone oil paper is heat-resistant and has no safety problems. Some silicone oil papers distinguish between the front and back sides, so pay attention when using them.
> - 12. Mold: Help the bread to shape when baking. There are no excessive requirements for bread baking molds, but the cake baking molds must be made of anodized aluminum and it is best to spray an oil-surface mixture to help the cake climb.
> - Gluten flour: This is protein extracted from wheat, which forms a grid-like structure after absorbing water. It is widely used in daily life, such as gluten, etc.
> - Vanilla extract: Vanilla extract is a highly purified natural food flavor extracted from vanilla. It is often used to make vanilla-flavored foods and is also used to neutralize异味 (异味) (peculiar smells) such as egg腥味 (腥味) (fishy smell).

## Calculation

**Note: Although the specific amount of raw materials is given, the indoor temperature, indoor humidity, and even the amount of yeast in the air will affect the production process. This recipe will give adjustment suggestions as much as possible during the production process.**

cup is a commonly used baking unit of measurement because it can be easily converted between volume and weight. 1 cup = 250 ml. Generally, 1 cup of flour = 120 g. See additional content for more conversions.

Here, cup is used for larger amounts, and g is used for smaller amounts.

Per serving:

- **Yeast Head**
  - Flour 1 cup (use a spoon to scrape off the excess after filling a cup, do not shake)
  - 30 ℃ warm water (not too hot) 1 cup
  - Yeast 2 g
  - Salt 2 g
- **Dough**
  - Flour 2½ cup
  - Eggs 1
  - Sugar or syrup ⅛ cup
  - Dairy products a total of ¼ cup after mixing (milk powder needs to be mixed with water.)
  - Butter or corn oil ⅛ cup
  - Gluten flour ¼ ~ ½ cup (optional)
  - Vanilla extract 3 g (optional)

## Operation

### Making the Yeast Head

The yeast head is a pre-fermented product. Through pre-fermentation, not only can the success rate be improved, but also the longer fermentation time will make the bread taste better. If conditions permit, the yeast head should be fermented for 4 days to achieve the best flavor. But for novices, the finished product presented by the yeast head fermented for 30 minutes is already very considerable. Next, make the yeast head.

![Ideal state of yeast head before fermentation](./4-1酵头1.jpg)

1. First, mix the yeast and ***30℃ warm water*** evenly with a scraper or kitchen utensils, and let stand for 5 minutes. Then mix with flour and stir well. At this time, the yeast head should be a **particularly viscous** batter.

![Cover the yeast head with a cloth](./4-2酵头2.jpg)

2. Cover the batter with a cloth and place the batter in a **warm place** to ferment for 45 ~ 60 minutes.

![Final form of yeast head](./4-3酵头3.jpg)

3. The final batter should have many bubbles on the surface and the volume should be significantly increased.

**Fermentation failed? Look here:**

> 1. Make sure the yeast has not expired
> 2. Make sure the water temperature is appropriate
> 3. Extend the fermentation time, you can put it in the refrigerator overnight
> 4. The temperature may not be enough. At this time, you can preheat the oven to 60℃, and put it in the oven to ferment after stopping heating.
> 5. You can add an equal amount of yeast, stir well, and ferment again and extend the fermentation time
> 6. You can try adding 3g of sugar to ferment again

**How to make a "permanent" yeast head?**

> With a yeast head, it is not a dream to bake bread at any time! A "permanent" yeast head can be made according to the following methods:
>
> 1. After making the yeast head according to the above method, put it in a cool place (even in the refrigerator!) Sprinkle a thin layer of flour on it every 1-3 days (just the thickness that you can't see the batter!) Stir again, and then continue to cover with a cloth to ferment. If the fermentation is too fast and the volume is too large, you can throw away a part of it.
> 2. When you start making bread, just leave the yeast head with the volume before fermentation to continue fermentation, and the rest is used for making bread.
> 3. Over time, the yeast head will produce a unique fragrance, which is the best "raw material" for bread!

### Making the Dough

With the yeast head, you are half way to success!

![Dough at this time](./4-4此时的面团.jpg)

1. Mix all the remaining ingredients with the yeast head with a scraper and stir. Be sure to scrape the wall when stirring to make it fully mixed. When a dough is formed and there is no dry flour, press the dough with a clean, dry hand, and hold the container with the other hand to form a large dough, and then pour it on a panel or silicone pad for operation

> At this time, the ground dough should have formed and be relatively soft. If it cannot be formed and is very sticky, it means that there is too little flour. You can add ¼ cup of flour and stir thoroughly again until it is formed. If the dough has formed or there is a lot of dry flour, it means that the kneading time is not enough. At this time, you can increase the kneading time.
>
> When pressing the dough, push the dough open with your fist, then fold it in half and push it open again, repeating this process to knead all the flour on the container wall into the dough.

2. Use the lower part of your palm to push the dough open, then fold it in half and push it open again until there are no dry flour clumps on the surface. The dough is not very smooth at this time.

> If you use a panel during this process, there may be a small amount of adhesion. At this time, you can shovel it off with a scraper or knife.
>
> If the dough is formed but is relatively hard, it means that there is too little water. At this time, you can use a damp hand or a sprayer to evenly cover the surface with water and cover with a damp cloth to let it stand and ferment for 20 minutes, repeating this process.

![Transfer to container](./4-5转移到容器内.jpg)

3. Use a sprayer to spray a layer of vegetable oil (or spread it evenly by hand) on the inside of a container that is at least three times the size of the current dough, put the dough in and cover it with a cloth, and ferment for 1 hour.

> If there is a problem with fermentation, please refer to the solution for fermentation failure under Yeast Head Production.
>
> The surface of the fermented dough should be sticky. If not, you can use a damp hand or a sprayer to evenly cover the surface with water and ferment again for 20 minutes.

4. At this time, the dough should be twice as large as before. Sprinkle a thin layer of flour on the panel or silicone pad (you can see the thickness of the panel or silicone pad), then take out the dough and use your hands to flatten the dough to排气 (排气) (release the air).
5. Then use a rolling pin to roll it into a 1 cm thick sheet. And tightly and without leaving gaps, roll it up from one side.
6. Then rotate 90°, repeat step 4 and step 5.
7. Shape the bread and put it on a baking tray lined with silicone oil paper or a mold coated with oil. Note that the seam is facing down.

> You can spray a layer of oil evenly on the baking tray or spread a thin layer of butter before placing the silicone oil paper. This way the silicone oil paper will not move around.

8. Ferment in a tray or mold for 30 ~ 45 minutes.

> If there is a problem with fermentation, please refer to the solution for fermentation failure under Yeast Head Production.

9. At the same time, preheat the oven.

> Preheat the oven: Turn the oven to the highest temperature and bake for at least 20 minutes.

10. Use scissors or a knife to cut a few seams on the bread as the bread pattern.
11. Brush with egg wash. (optional)

![Finished product](./4-6成品面包.jpg)

11. Put it in the oven and bake at 180℃ for 30 minutes on the upper and lower fires, then adjust to 165 ℃ and bake for another 10 minutes.

> The temperature of different ovens is different. Observe the bread during the baking process. If there is no obvious discoloration after 30 minutes, the temperature is too low. At this time, increase the temperature by 5 ~ 10 ℃ or bake for 5 ~ 10 minutes more
> After the baking is over, taste the bread. If the surface of the bread is bitter (note that as long as it is not bitter, it is not considered over-baking), then the temperature is too high. Try to lower the temperature by 5 ~ 10 ℃ or reduce the baking time by 5 ~ 10 minutes;
> If the outside is already caramel-colored but the inside is not cooked, then lower the temperature by 5 ~ 15 ℃ and extend the baking time by 10 ~ 20 minutes.
>
> If the surface of the bread is very hard or cracked seriously, you can cover the bread with tin foil and remove the tin foil in the last ten minutes, or invert another baking tray and place it on the top, and then remove the tin foil or baking tray in the last 10 minutes.

12. After cooling, put it in a food bag and store it for a week. It can be stored in the freezer for a month.

> When sealed in a food bag overnight, the inside and surface of the bread will further soften. So the best time to taste it is the next morning.

2. How to save extra bread

 You can slice the bread and freeze it. When using it next time, you can place it at room temperature and wait for it to warm up, or you can heat it directly. But **never put it in the refrigerator!** The moisture in the bread will be lost quickly in the refrigerator.

3. Recommended eating method

![Finished product](./5-1成品.jpg)

a. Take a large piece of bread and divide it into two halves. Put it in a pot and heat over low heat (generally no oil needs to be added, but if you want a crispy skin, you can spread butter on the surface of the bread and then fry it) for 1 ~ 2 minutes.
b. Spray 3 ~ 4 pumps of oil into the pot with a sprayer, and heat over high heat until the pot is slightly smoking, then turn to the lowest heat.
c. Then add an egg and cover the lid. Wait 2 ~ 3 minutes. Then turn it over and heat for another 2 ~ 3 minutes.
(This is the method of making a runny egg. If you need a fully cooked egg, you can add up to 1 ml of water before turning it over, turn to medium-low heat, and burn the water until it is dry. This will give you a fully cooked egg)
d. Spread any sauce you like on both sides of the bread and夹 (夹) (sandwich) the egg in the middle.
