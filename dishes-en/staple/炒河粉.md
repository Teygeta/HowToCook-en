# Stir-fried Rice Noodles Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   Stir-fried rice noodles, pork/beef
*   Stir-fry ingredients: salt, MSG, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, cumin powder (or use rice noodle seasoning directly)
*   Other seasonings: pepper
*   Cucumber, gluten cubes, mung bean sprouts, eggs, garlic cloves, scallions, starch
*   Basin, plate

> Recommended purchase plan: Buy bagged fresh rice noodles on platforms such as 某宝 (Taobao) and 某买菜 (a grocery platform). They are generally sold in quantities of 1 catty (500g) or more, and have a refrigerated shelf life of up to two weeks. They also come with rice noodle stir-fry seasoning!

## Calculation

*   The amount of rice noodles is 250 g/person. If you need a larger portion, you can add another 100g/person, rounded down.
*   Shredded cucumber 30g/person, gluten cubes 30g/person, mung bean sprouts 30g/person, broken eggs 1/person.
*   Crushed garlic cloves 2/person, scallions 1/person
*   Rice noodle seasoning can be added at 20g/person. If you prepare the stir-fry ingredients yourself, you can use 10g salt + 2g MSG + 3g cumin powder.
*   Starch can be prepared at a ratio of 5g starch per 100g meat.
*   Dark soy sauce/light soy sauce, 10ml/15ml per 250g rice noodles respectively.

## Operation

### Preparation

*   Chop the scallions (separate the white and green parts), crush the garlic cloves, and discard them on the cutting board for later use.
*   Break the eggs, scoop a little egg white into a bowl, and discard the rest into another bowl for later use.
*   Put the mung bean sprouts into the pot and boil over high heat for 60 seconds. Remove the bean sprouts, rinse with cold water, and put them on a plate for later use.
*   Cut the cucumber into shreds and put it on a plate for later use. You can discard it with the bean sprouts.
*   Process the gluten and discard it on a separate plate.
*   Cut the meat into thin strips, add starch and the egg white and pepper in the bowl just now, and mix well clockwise.
*   Note: The surface of the cold skin purchased from the supermarket generally has cooking oil, which can be cleaned with tap water. The same goes for gluten.
*   Note: After cleaning the gluten, please use your hands to squeeze out a lot of water from the gluten (do not use too much force).

### Heat the pot and stir-fry the meat

*   Add cooking oil, heat the pot and pour it out.
*   Pour in the processed meat, stir-fry evenly until it changes color, pour it into a bowl and set aside.

### Stir-fry the rice noodles

*   While the pot is hot, add 20g of cooking oil (people with high blood pressure can reduce the amount), pour in the white parts of the scallions and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.
*   Add the rice noodles, pour in dark soy sauce to add color, stir-fry evenly, then add the rice noodle stir-fry ingredients and continue to stir-fry.
*   When the rice noodles are about to become transparent, add the stir-fried shredded meat and gluten, and add light soy sauce to enhance the flavor, and stir-fry twice briefly.
*   Add the bean sprouts and shredded cucumber and stir-fry until the rice noodles are completely transparent.
*   Turn off the heat!

### Final steps

*   Sprinkle with chopped scallion leaves to garnish and lift the pot.
*   Pour it on a plate and start eating.
