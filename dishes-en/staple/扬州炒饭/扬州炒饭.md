Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Cold rice (a little drier is better)
- Eggs
- Frozen peeled shrimp
- Luncheon meat can
- Green beans
- Carrots
- Corn kernels (optional)
- Scallions
- Oil
- Salt

## Calculation

You need to determine how many servings you plan to make before each production. One serving is enough for 1-2 people.

Per serving:

- Cold rice 500g
- Eggs 2-3
- Frozen peeled shrimp 10-15
- Luncheon meat can 150g (recommended Shanghai Maling ham luncheon meat can, 340g per can, use half a can at a time)
- Green beans 30g
- Carrots 30g
- Corn kernels 30g
- Scallions 1
- Oil 30-40ml
- Salt 12-15g

## Operation

- Cut the carrots into 0.2cm*0.2cm*0.2cm cubes and set aside
- Cut the luncheon meat into 0.2cm*0.2cm*0.2cm cubes and set aside
- Take the white and green parts of the scallions separately, cut each into 0.25-0.5cm small sections, and set aside separately
- Beat the eggs into a bowl, stir evenly, and set aside
- Cook the carrots, green beans, and corn kernels, take them out, and set aside (don't pour out the water)
- Cook the shrimp, take them out, and set aside (the water can be poured out)
- Heat the pot with hot oil, you can refer to the hot pot double oil in[Learning to Stir-fry and Pan-fry](../../../tips/learn/学习炒与煎.md)
  - The second time you pour oil, you need to use 20-30ml of oil. After the second time the cold oil is hot, slowly pour in the eggs (control the diameter of the flow from the bowl to the oil to be about 0.5cm) and do not stir
- Take out the eggs immediately after they solidify and set aside
- Pour the luncheon meat, green beans, carrots, corn kernels, and shrimp into the pot and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, put them on a plate and set aside
- Rinse the pot with water to clean up the debris and ensure that the pot is clean (there can be oil but no impurities)
- Heat the pot with hot oil (10ml), add the white parts of the scallions and stir-fry until fragrant
- Adjust to low heat (if the oil temperature is too high, you can turn off the heat for 1-2 minutes), add the rice, quickly smash the rice with a spatula and stir-fry to ensure that the rice is evenly coated with oil and the grains are distinct
- Pour in the eggs and continue to smash to break up the eggs and mix them thoroughly with the rice
- Turn to high heat, pour in all other prepared ingredients, and stir-fry quickly for 1-2 minutes
- Sprinkle in salt and stir-fry until fully mixed
- Sprinkle in the green parts of the scallions and stir-fry for 1 minute
- Turn off the heat and serve
