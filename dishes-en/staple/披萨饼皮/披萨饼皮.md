![The example is green and red pepper ham pizza](./001.jpeg)

Pizza making is relatively simple in general. The slightly troublesome and most controversial part is the pizza crust. Once the pizza crust is made, you can put the prepared ingredients on it and bake it, so here we will focus on how to make the pizza crust.

The crust in this tutorial belongs to the soft dough low-temperature overnight fermentation

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

**Raw materials**

- Medium-gluten flour
- Water (warm water)
- Angel dry yeast powder
- Salt
- Olive oil
- White sugar

**Tools**

- Oven
- Baking oil paper
- Pizza stone (better to have, ordinary baking tray is also possible)
- Rolling pin (not necessary)

## Calculation

A 8 ~ 9 inch pizza needs about 125g of flour, which is about the amount for one person (just enough for an adult male)

The mixing ratio of raw materials

```text
Flour : Water : Olive oil : Yeast powder : Salt : Sugar
100 : 70 : 7 : 1 : 0.6 : 0.6
```

Example

If you want to make 4 crusts at a time, you need:

- Flour 125g x 4= 500g,
- Water 70 x 5 = 350g,
- Olive oil 7 x 5 =35g,
- Yeast powder 1 x 5 = 5g,
- Salt 0.6 x 5 = 3g,
- Sugar 0.6 x 5 = 3g

## Operation

- Dissolve the yeast powder with the prepared warm water, stir it slightly, and set aside
- Take the prepared flour and add salt, olive oil, and white sugar in order
- Prepare to mix water and flour, add water while stirring until all the water is added
- Stir until you can't see any dry rice flour
- Pack it in a container that is about three times the size of the dough, seal it, and refrigerate it in the refrigerator (4 degrees) **Wait 8~12 hours, usually you can use it the next day if you do it at night**
- Observe that the dough is proofed **It is considered proofed when it is about twice the original size**
- Take the proofed dough, divide it evenly into four parts, cover each with plastic wrap, and set aside
- Sprinkle a little more dry flour on the cutting board to prepare for kneading
- Because it is a relatively wet dough, it will not be so sticky after sticking to dry flour. You don't need to knead it too many times, just make the surface of the dough slightly smooth
- Pull it with your hands, or flatten it with a rolling pin. It doesn't necessarily have to be rolled into a circle, as long as the thickness is even and the oven can fit it
- Spread the oil paper, put on the crust, put the prepared ingredients on it according to personal taste, and sprinkle with shredded cheese
- Fruit oven, upper 180 degrees, lower 220 degrees, 16 minutes
- Meat and vegetables oven, upper 200 degrees, lower 230 degrees, 18 minutes
- Squeeze on salad dressing or other sauces you like and enjoy~

## Additional Content

- Be sure to pay attention to the ratio of water
- The quality of ovens varies, so pay attention to observing the effect of heat on the pizza for the first time
- Generally, if it is not specifically marked as low-gluten or high-gluten flour, it is basically medium-gluten flour
- Fruits that are prone to water cannot be used as ingredients, such as watermelon, oranges, etc.
