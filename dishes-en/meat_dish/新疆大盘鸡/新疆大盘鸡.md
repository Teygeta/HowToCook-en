Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Sichuan peppercorns, bay leaves, cardamom, dried chili peppers, garlic, green onion
- Oil, salt, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, cooking wine (beer can be used), white sugar
- Chicken (chicken thighs are best), potatoes, bell peppers and sweet peppers (optional, add for better color matching)

## Calculation

For 2 people

- Chicken from two fire legs (this is about 1kg)
- Potatoes 2 medium size: 750g
- Green onion 100g
- Bell peppers and sweet peppers one each, 50g each
- White sugar 20g
- Dried chili peppers 5
- Garlic 4 cloves
- Oil 50g

## Operation

- Chop the meat first, into chunks, soak in clear water + salt for 5 minutes to remove blood and fishy smell, then drain the water
- Wash green onions, garlic, chili peppers, potatoes, etc., peel the potatoes
- Cut the green onion white into long sections, 4cm each, and cut the bell peppers and chili peppers into chunks
- Cut the potatoes into rolling potatoes, that is, cut one piece and roll it, and each potato should be about 4cm*4cm
- Stir-fry the sugar color: first add oil to the pot, then add white sugar, stir back and forth with a spatula, melt the sugar, and then stir-fry until it turns caramel color. At this time, pour the drained chicken into the pot and stir-fry to color it
- Add Sichuan peppercorns, bay leaves, cardamom, dried chili peppers, etc. and stir-fry
- Add 5g salt, 7ml light soy sauce, 10g oyster sauce, 100g cooking wine, pour in 1 liter of clear water, cooking wine can be replaced with beer
- Turn to medium heat, bring the water to a boil, then turn to medium-low heat and simmer until flavorful
- When the water is reduced until the chicken is about to be exposed, put the potatoes on the surface of the pot: be careful not to stir the potatoes, just cover them on the surface, otherwise they will easily stick to the pot if turned to the bottom, continue to cover the pot and simmer, and after a while, add the green onion, bell peppers and sweet peppers, and continue to simmer.
- When the juice is almost reduced, you can turn it over, let the potatoes absorb the soup, and finally turn off the heat and serve.

**Also: This method can be eaten with noodles. Buy thick noodle seeds, flatten the thick noodle seeds, and then pull them into wide noodles by hand. Be sure to use wide noodles. After cooking, you can put them into the big plate chicken and stir with the soup for an excellent taste!**
