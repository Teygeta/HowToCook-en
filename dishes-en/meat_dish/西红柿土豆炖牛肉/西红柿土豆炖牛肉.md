  - Cut out 4g of scallion for scallion, and break the rest into 5-8cm sections
  - Soak the beef in cold water for half an hour to remove blood, or boil it in cold water until the surface turns white, remove it, and skim off the floating foam during the period
  - Cut the onion into 0.5-1cm small pieces
- Production
  - Medium heat throughout
  - Cold water covers the beef, put it in a pressure cooker, add scallion sections, ginger slices, add 20g cooking wine, bring to a boil and pressure for 20 minutes
  - After taking out the beef, cut it into 5cm pieces, pick out the ginger, and put the soup in a large bowl for stewing later

  - (Optional) You can add a little salt to make the onion release water and not easy to burn, don’t add too much, season later

- Stewing

## Additional content

- Make sure the soup is warm when adding it during stewing
- Do not cover the lid during stewing, otherwise the potatoes will be烂
- Stir occasionally during stewing to avoid糊bottom
- It will be more delicious to stew in a casserole. You can stir-fry in a wok and pour it into a cooking pot for stewing. If you use a casserole, do not use high heat before boiling to avoid cracking
- Don’t add too much soy sauce, it will become salty when the soup is concentrated. It’s okay if it’s slightly light when it’s thin. You can add more soy sauce if you think it’s not enough during stewing
- Do not use chicken essence or MSG, it will rob the鲜味of the beef
