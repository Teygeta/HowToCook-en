# How to Make Steak

![Steak Product](./牛排.jpg)

Steak is a popular Western meat dish, rich in protein, fat, and minerals such as iron and zinc. The steak cooking process uses flexible cooking techniques (such as frying, grilling, slow cooking, and aging) to control the doneness of the steak, from rare (pink in the center) to well-done (completely cooked). High-temperature cooking can form a焦香 crust, and the combination of salt, garlic, butter, and spices can create a rich flavor. Steak cooking is relatively simple to get started, but difficult to master. This article mainly introduces the simplest pan-fried steak, and the entire cooking process takes 15-30 minutes. The illustration shows short ribs cooked to medium rare.

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Frying pan (cast iron frying pan is recommended if available)
- Aluminum foil (optional)
- Kitchen paper (optional)
- Spoon
- Steak, see [How to choose different types of steak](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/72352426)
- Olive oil (extra virgin olive oil is recommended)
- Butter
- Salt (coarse sea salt is recommended)
- Black pepper powder (coarse ground black pepper is recommended)
- Garlic
- Spices (optional, rosemary or thyme is recommended, try to use fresh plant branches instead of powders made from these spices)
- Pre-made steak sauce (optional)
- Side dishes (optional, prepare according to your preferences, asparagus, mushrooms, small tomatoes, and small potatoes are recommended, choose 1-2 of them)

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is enough for 2 people.

Per serving:

- Steak 450-500g (two steaks)
- Black pepper powder 2g
- Salt 5g
- Garlic 1 (about 25-30g, the actual amount used is about 5-10g)
- Olive oil 10-15ml
- Butter 20-25g
- Mushrooms 5-10
- Small potatoes 5-10 (about 20g each)
- Small tomatoes 5-10 (about 15g each)
- Thyme 2g (if using fresh thyme branches, take 3-6 branches, each about 10cm long)

## Operation

### Prepare ingredients

1. Take the steak out of the refrigerator to thaw.

  - If the steak is frozen, transfer it to the refrigerator the night before and place it at room temperature for half an hour before cooking.
  - **Do not** put the steak **in water or heat it to thaw**.

2. Wash the small tomatoes, small potatoes, and mushrooms, cut them in half and set aside.
3. Peel the garlic, keep 5-8 larger cloves, and **flatten** them with the back of a knife for later use.
4. Pre-treatment of steak

  - For ribeye steak (see [How to choose different types of steak](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/72352426)), use kitchen scissors to insert vertically into the connective tissue in the center of the ribeye steak and cut 1-2 times. This is because the "eye" of the ribeye steak (that is, this connective tissue) will shrink violently under high temperature, causing the steak to deform and make it impossible for the steak to be heated evenly.
  - For sirloin steak, if you don't like the fat on the side of the sirloin steak, you can use a knife to slowly remove it.
  - Then, wrap the steak with kitchen paper and absorb all the water attached to the steak until the steak does not leave obvious water marks on the cutting board after being picked up.

### Cooking

 Note: This process is suitable for making 2-3cm thick, medium rare steaks. If you prefer different doneness, consider increasing or shortening the first half of the frying time by 20-30%.

1. Turn on the stove to high heat (see the appendix for instructions on the size of the heat), and add olive oil to the pot at the same time, heat the pot for 15-30 seconds.
2. Marinate the steak. Sprinkle sea salt and black pepper evenly on all surfaces of the steak and rub it by hand, so that the salt and pepper particles are embedded in the meat as much as possible. Note that the steak **needs to be put into the pot immediately after marinating, and it is not recommended to marinate the steak in advance**. This is because the salt applied on the surface will precipitate the water in the beef, which will affect the cooking and lose the flavor.
3. Heat the pot to 6-8% oil temperature (see [Oil Temperature Judgment Tips](./../../../tips/advanced/油温判断技巧)), and slowly put the steak into the pot from near to far.
4. If you use potatoes as a side dish, you can put the potatoes in a bowl and heat them in the microwave for 10 minutes, or put them in boiling water and cook for 3-5 minutes.
5. Fry one side for 1.5 minutes (this time is suitable for steaks about 2-3cm thick. If your steak is thinner, consider shortening this time to 1 minute. If your steak is thicker, consider increasing this time to 2-2.5 minutes.)
6. Turn it over and fry for another 1.5 minutes.

  - For sirloin and fillet steaks, you need to use chopsticks or a spatula to stand the steak up and fry its sides for about 30 seconds.

7. Switch the stove to medium heat, then quickly add butter, garlic, and thyme in order. Use a spatula to quickly spread the butter in the pot until it is completely melted. Press the garlic under the steak to increase the flavor.
8. Place the frying pan **at an angle on the stove** so that all the oil flows to one side of the pan.
9. Place the spices and garlic on the steak, use a spoon to scoop up the oil in the pot, and keep pouring it on the steak. This process lasts for 30 seconds, then turn the steak over and repeat this process for another 30 seconds.

  - You can judge the current heat by observing the state of the oil when it is poured on the surface of the steak. If the oil bubbles when poured on the steak and the color of the oil does not turn dark brown, the oil temperature is suitable.
  - If your steak is not wiped clean or thawed using an unrecommended method, or if salt is used for pre-marinating, a lot of water will appear in the pot at this time, causing the steak to be "cooked" instead of fried, thus losing its flavor.
  - If a lot of oil bubbles appear on the surface of the steak and the color of the oil turns dark brown, it means that the oil temperature is too high. You need to move the pot away from the stove and wait for a while before continuing to pour oil.

10. Take out the steak and place it on a cutting board, wrap it in aluminum foil, and wait for 5-10 minutes. The purpose of this process (called resting the meat) is to use the steak's own temperature to continue heating and lock in the moisture.
11. Pour the side dishes (potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms) into the pot and fry over medium heat for 5 minutes.
12. Take out the steak, cut it into meat strips with a width of 1.5cm, and you can observe the doneness of the beef at this time.
13. Take out the side dishes, put them on a plate, and drizzle with the remaining oil or steak sauce (optional) in the pot

### Control of heat

Frying steak is the art of controlling the heat. Due to space limitations, here are some quantitative methods for evaluating the heat and the terms related to the heat used in this article. See [Oil Temperature Judgment Tips](./../../../tips/advanced/油温判断技巧) for more information.

- For induction cooker:
  - High fire: power 1.8Kw - 2.2kw.
  - Medium fire: power 800w - 1.4kw.
  - Low fire: power 200w - 600w.
- For gas stove:
  - High fire: Rotate the gas valve to 70%-90% of the maximum air output speed.
  - Medium fire: Rotate the gas valve to 40%-60% of the maximum air output speed.
  - Low fire: Rotate the gas valve to 10%-30% of the maximum air output speed.

### About seasoning

Steak seasoning does not necessarily need to follow the specifications in this guide. Generally speaking, garlic, black pepper, and butter are essential, but if you don’t like the taste of labiates such as rosemary or thyme, you are free to try other steak seasonings for seasoning. There are also a variety of barbecue seasoning salts sold on the market to choose from. The author once discovered a combination of Chinese and Western methods, that is, cutting small hot peppers and garlic slices and frying them in olive oil, and using them as a seasoning to drizzle on the steak at the end, which also has a unique flavor.
