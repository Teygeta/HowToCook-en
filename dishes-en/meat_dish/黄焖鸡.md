## Operation

- Slice the ginger and cut the dried chili peppers into **small circles**
- Slice the mushrooms and cut the green pepper into thin and long **horseshoe shapes**
- Stir-fry sugar color: pour base oil into the pot, add white sugar when the oil is cold
- Heat slowly over low heat, wait for the oil temperature to gradually rise, the white sugar begins to melt and becomes a darker brown (stir constantly during this period to prevent the pot from burning)
- Quickly pour in the chicken pieces, turn to high heat, and stir-fry quickly! Pour in cooking wine and continue to stir-fry for a while
- Pour in the ginger slices and dried chili peppers
- Add soy sauce and stir well
- Pour in clear water, enough to cover the chicken
- Pour in mushroom slices, white pepper powder, and salt
- After stir-frying evenly, cover the pot and simmer, turn to medium-low heat for **15-20 minutes**, you can transfer to a casserole if you have the conditions
- After the chicken is soft and rotten and the soup is thick (do not dry the soup too much), finally add the green pepper
- Add monosodium glutamate, stir-fry evenly, turn off the heat! The green pepper can be basically raw, do not stir-fry for a long time
