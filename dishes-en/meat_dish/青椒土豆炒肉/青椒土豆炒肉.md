## Essential Ingredients and Tools

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 2 people to eat.

Per serving:

- Green pepper 2 (approximately 200g in total)
- Potato 2 (approximately 300g in total)
- Pork 200g
- Scallions 1 (approximately 10g)
- Ginger 1 piece (approximately 5g)
- Garlic 3 cloves (approximately 12g)
- Salt 7g
- Soy sauce 6-10ml
- Cooking oil 10-15ml
- Potato starch 5g
- Water 15g

## Operation

- Remove the roots of the green pepper and cut into small pieces, peel the potatoes and cut into 2mm thin slices, cut the pork into 4mm thin slices, cut the scallions horizontally and vertically into 3mm small sections, mince the peeled ginger and garlic; add about 15g of water to the potato starch and stir well to make water starch.
- Heat the pot and heat the oil, heat to 70% heat and put in the pork slices, slowly stir-fry until the meat turns red, add about 3ml of soy sauce, stir-fry the meat slices evenly to color, add about 2g of salt.
- Turn to 50% oil temperature, add scallions, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 5 seconds, then add potato slices, turn to 70% oil temperature and stir-fry evenly, add about 5ml of soy sauce and 2g of salt, stir-fry until the potatoes are cooked and the surface is slightly焦yellow.
- Turn to 80% oil temperature and add green pepper, stir-fry over high heat to get the pot gas (white smoke comes out), stir-fry repeatedly and evenly for 1 minute to color, finally pour the water starch around the pot and turn to 40% heat to thicken the sauce.
- Turn off the heat and plate after the appearance is *sticky*.
