## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Beef (you can use beef tenderloin or steak)
- Onion
- Vegetable pepper (red/yellow pepper)
- Starch
- Black pepper (powder)
- Black pepper (marinade)
- Salt
- Peanut oil

Note: Powder and marinade can be substituted for each other, please refer to the instructions on the food packaging you purchased for the specific dosage.

It is recommended to use a non-stick pan.

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 2-3 people to eat

Total amount:

- Beef amount = number of servings * 100 grams (increase or decrease depending on the diner's stomach capacity and pot capacity)
- Onion amount = number of servings * 1/12 (ie cut about 1/4 for 3 people)
- Vegetable pepper amount = number of servings * 1/12 (ie cut about 1/4 for 3 people)
- Salt amount = number of servings * 1 gram
- Starch = number of servings * 3 grams
- Black pepper marinade = marinate according to the instructions of the purchased product
- Black pepper powder = number of servings * 1 gram (actually sprinkle casually)
- Peanut oil = number of servings * 10ml (in fact, the amount of oil changes according to the amount of vegetables, if the amount of beef is increased or decreased, please change according to the corresponding ratio)

Use the above conditions to calculate the planned ratio of raw materials.

## Operation

- Cut the beef into strips, the length is best controlled below 8 cm, the thickness is about 5-10 mm, and the width is about 1 cm (the requirements are not strict)
- Marinate the beef with marinade, mix well and let it stand, please refer to the product instructions for the amount and time, it can be extended but not shortened.
- If you use liquid marinade, you can sprinkle a layer of black pepper powder three minutes before the end of marinating, then add starch, mix well again and let it stand for 20 minutes.
- Turn on the fire, heat the pot, add peanut oil.
- When you can see a trace of smoke coming out of the oil in the pot, add the beef and stir-fry.
- Turn on medium heat to high heat, stir-fry for 2 minutes until the outside of the beef changes color (that is, there is no obvious blood color, the blood-colored part indicates that the stir-fry is not in place) (be careful of oil splashing here).
- Add onion and vegetable pepper, stir-fry for 2 minutes.
- Add salt, sprinkle another portion of black pepper powder, stir-fry for 30 seconds, and mix well.
- Observe that the onion has softened, then turn off the heat, take it out of the pot, and plate it.
