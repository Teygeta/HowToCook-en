- Cut the `pork belly` into large pieces (about 4.5cm)
- Cut the `ginger` into slices (each slice about 3mm thick)
- Boil `boiling water`
- `Cold water` tap water is fine
- Cut the white part of the `small onion` into small sections (small onion is best, large onion is also acceptable)
- Cut the `garlic` in the middle, do not flatten it, otherwise it will be difficult to remove and affect the taste when `collecting the juice` at the end
- It is recommended to take out half of the green onion and ginger first, and then put the remaining `ginger, white onion, garlic, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves` into a bowl in advance for later use
- Put the cut pork belly into a pot with cold water, add cooking wine and 2/5 of the green onion and ginger, cook for 15 minutes to remove the fishy smell, take it out and wash it clean;
- Stir-fry [Caramelizing Sugar](./../../condiment/糖色.md), pay attention to using operation 2 mentioned in it to make the sugar color.
- Pour the prepared `ginger, white onion, garlic, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves` and `pork belly` into the pot and stir-fry over `high heat`, add until you smell the aroma, pour boiling water to submerge all the meat and simmer for 50 minutes-60 minutes
  - 40 minutes in a pressure cooker;
- Add 10ml of cooking wine;
- After covering the pot and cooking until boiling, open the lid every 25 minutes to scoop out the oil and foam floating on the surface;
- When the height of the water is reduced to 3/5 of the height of the meat and the bottom of the pot, turn to medium heat, and remove all the auxiliary materials except the meat and water, and start to collect the juice;
- Open the lid, wait for the soup to be almost gone and become viscous, then take it out of the pot (remember not to dry it);
