## Operation

- Scrape and wash the meat, put it in a cooking pot and cook until it is 60% cooked (the color turns white), take it out and apply honey and vinegar to the meat skin while it is hot.
- Put cooked lard in a wok and heat it over high heat until it is 80% hot (about 200 degrees, there is a lot of blue smoke on the oil surface, and the oil is calm). Put the meat pieces in with the skin facing down and fry until golden red. Take it out and soak it in the cold meat cooking pot (the cooking pot that was cooked before) to soften it. Place it on a cutting board and cut it into three-inch (10 cm) long and two-fen (0.6 cm) thick slices. Still with the skin facing down, neatly place them in a steaming bowl.
- Cut 5 grams of green onion into 2.4 cm long sections and 5 grams into 2.4 cm long diagonal slices. Peel and wash the ginger, cut 1.5 grams into slices and 5 grams into minced pieces. Cut the scrambled egg skin into 2.4 cm long isosceles triangle slices.
- Cook the Shangzhi in a boiling water pot until soft, remove it, remove the old stems and impurities, wash it clean, cut it into 3 cm long sections, put it in a bowl, add soy sauce (5 grams), refined salt (1 gram), and cooked lard (10 grams), mix well, cover it on the meat slices, and put the chicken broth (100 grams) into a small bowl, add soy sauce (5 grams), refined salt (0.5 grams), and cooking wine (15 grams), stir well, pour it into the steaming bowl, then add ginger slices, green onion sections, and star anise to the cage and steam over high heat for about half an hour, then turn to low heat and continue to steam for about one hour and thirty minutes. After it is cooked and soft, take it out, pick out the ginger, green onion, and star anise, pour and filter the original juice, and buckle the meat into the soup plate.
- In a wok, put chicken broth (100 grams), add the original juice, bring to a boil over high heat, add minced ginger, green onion slices, and monosodium glutamate, stir well, put in the scrambled egg skin, drizzle with sesame oil, and pour it into the soup plate.

## Additional content

- Shangzhi is a specialty that is not particularly famous in small places. At least I have not seen it in other places. When making it, you can replace it with other fern vegetables.
