- Use a toothpick to poke some small holes in the blood sausage, then put it in water and simmer over low heat for ten minutes. Do not let the water boil, keep it at 80 degrees, otherwise the blood sausage will burst very easily.
- Cut the cooked blood sausage into pieces for later use.
- Blanch the spareribs with cooking wine, drain the water and set aside.
- Put rapeseed oil in the pot, add garlic cloves, dried chili, and ginger powder and stir-fry until fragrant.
- Add spareribs and stir-fry until the surface is golden brown.
- Wash the sauerkraut, squeeze dry, put it in the pot, add sesame oil and stir-fry. Sesame oil can better remove the sour taste and make the sauerkraut more fragrant. Stir-fry over high heat for two minutes.
- Add 600 ml of hot water.
- Transfer to an electric pressure cooker, add bay leaf, star anise, scallion knot, and salt.
- Press for 40 minutes in rich aroma mode.
- After the time is up, release the pressure and open the lid. Add blood sausage and wolfberry, cover the pot and simmer for two minutes. The blood sausage is cooked and does not need to be heated again.
- Pour into a basin, prepare the dipping sauce according to the table above, and you can start eating.
