## Operation

### Chicken feet processing

- Use scissors/knife to cut off all the nails on the chicken feet **including the meat and bones under the nails, so that there are no nails left**
- Wash them with water and set aside
- Put the `chicken feet` into a large pot to remove the fishy smell
- Put all the `green onion`, `cooking wine`, and `ginger` in
- Add water to submerge the `chicken feet`
- Bring to a boil over high heat **You can skim off the foam in the middle**
- After the water boils **100 degrees, boiling**, wait for 10 minutes
- Turn off the heat, take it out, drain the water, wash it clean, and put it in a basin

### Deboning

This step can be omitted, this step takes about 2 hours

- Put it in the refrigerator, **freezing layer** for 20 minutes
- Put all of them in the refrigerator that is not the freezing layer, and then take out **10 pieces at a time** to debone
- Starting from the front end of the fingers (of the chicken feet), use a knife to cut each finger **to the back of the hand**
- Then use a knife to cut from the back of the hand to the entire arm
- Break each finger joint **like when your fingers make a sound**
- Press the front end of its fingers and push it inward, do the same for each finger, first push it to the middle palm and back of the hand
- After the skin of each finger is separated, push from the palm to the arm until the whole is removed
- Put it in a bowl for later use

### Prepare the marinade

- Cut `small hot peppers` into even small pieces
- Chop `garlic`, `onion`, and `coriander`
- Cut the `lemon` in half and squeeze the lemon juice into the chicken feet container
- Pour `all` the seasonings into the container containing the chicken feet, and also add `small hot peppers`, `garlic`, `onion` and `coriander`
- Grab and mix well
- Put it in the refrigerator overnight (6 hours)
- Put all the prepared ingredients into the chicken feet

## Additional content

- During operation, pay attention to observing the boiling water level. If it is found to be lower than 3/4 of the ingredients, add hot water to submerge the ingredients.
