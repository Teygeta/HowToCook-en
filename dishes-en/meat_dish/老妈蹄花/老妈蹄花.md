- Salt
- Garlic
- Small hot peppers
- White pepper powder

- Sichuan peppercorn oil
- Chili oil (optional)
- White kidney beans (seaweed can be used if not available)

## Calculation

One serving is enough for 2-3 people.

- Pig trotters: 3
- White kidney beans: 200g
- Angelica: 2g
- White pepper powder: 5g
- Ginger slices: 30g
- Angelica: 2g
- Minced garlic: 8g
- Chicken essence: 2g
- Light soy sauce: 25g
- Chopped green onion: 10g

## Operation

### Start making

- Soak 200g of white kidney beans in clean water overnight for later use
- Prepare the front trotters, ask the master to split them in the middle when buying vegetables, use a flamethrower to remove the hair follicles, and wash them at home
- Add pig trotters, green onion sections, ginger slices, and cooking wine to the pot with cold water to blanch for ten minutes, skim off the foam, take out and wash for later use
- Put the pig trotters, Dahurian angelica, Angelica, white pepper powder, and ginger slices into the pressure cooker, pressure for 30 minutes after the air comes out, add white kidney beans, and pressure for another 10 minutes. At this time, if the soup is milky white, then congratulations, it is correct (if you need to add water in the middle, you can only add hot water)
