## Operation

### Start making

* Cut the radish into pieces for later use
* Blanch the whole piece of beef brisket, add 2 slices of ginger and a handful of green onion knots, cook for 5-10 minutes after the water boils, then take it out and cut it into pieces
* Cut the beef brisket into pieces, cut it into the size you like (the beef brisket has been blanched, and it will basically not shrink when stewing later, so the large pieces will be stewed for a relatively short time)
* Prepare the sauce for stewing the beef brisket, mix the red fermented bean curd, Chu Hou paste, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and salt according to the above amount (I just ran out of rock sugar and replaced it with white sugar)
* Heat the pot and add oil, sauté the ginger and garlic until fragrant, add the beef brisket and stir-fry until dry, add the mixed sauce and stir-fry until fragrant, if you like a darker color, you can add a little dark soy sauce to brighten it
* Pour hot water after the seasonings are fully mixed
* Transfer the beef brisket to a soup pot, add cinnamon, star anise, bay leaf and dried chili, and simmer for about 2 hours
* Add white radish after the beef brisket is half soft and continue to simmer for 30 minutes
* It is finished when the radish is simmered until soft, and a pot of rich and fragrant radish and beef brisket is completed
