## Additional content

*   Fish sauce, also known as fish soy sauce, is a common condiment in Guangdong, Fujian and other places. The effect is similar to light soy sauce
*   During this production process, due to the epidemic, there was no rain露, so I had to replace it with dark soy sauce, so the color of the spare ribs was dark, and the normal color is golden yellow
