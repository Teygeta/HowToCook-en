## Calculation

Recommended ratio => Sugar : Water = 1 : 1, which makes it easy to control the amount of sugar. For example, if you want 15 grams of sugar, measure out 30 grams of syrup.

- Water: 100 grams
- Granulated sugar: 100 grams

## Instructions

1. Mix the measured granulated sugar with drinking water in the container.
2. Seal the container and refrigerate.

## Additional Information

Water can be hot or cold. If you need it quickly, you can dissolve it in hot water and then cool the syrup.

The prepared syrup does not spoil easily and can usually be stored in the refrigerator for a week without issues.
