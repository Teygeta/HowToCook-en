- Garlic
- Dried chili flakes
- Salt
- Roasted white sesame seeds
- Bird's eye chili
- Peanut oil (can be replaced with rapeseed oil)
- Small ceramic bowl
- Metal spoon
- Five-spice powder (optional)
- Tsaoko fruit (optional)
- Scallions (optional)
- Star anise
- Sichuan peppercorns
- Bay leaves
- Dahurian angelica root (Baizhi)
- Ginger slices (optional)
- Sugar
- White vinegar

## Calculation

- Garlic: 1 head
- Dried chili flakes: 100 grams
- Salt: 5 grams
- Roasted white sesame seeds: 15 grams
- Bird's eye chili: 1
- Peanut oil: 150 ml (can be replaced with rapeseed oil)
- Five-spice powder: 10 grams (optional)
- Tsaoko fruit: 1 (optional)
- Scallions: 3-5 (optional)
- Other spices: Star anise (1), Sichuan peppercorns (20-50, adjust to taste), Bay leaves (2-3), Dahurian angelica root (Baizhi) (2-3), Ginger slices (thick thumb-sized ginger, sliced) (optional)
- Sugar: 30 grams
- White vinegar: 5 ml (about one small metal spoonful)

## Instructions

- Take 2 small cloves of garlic and peel them.
- Take out a cutting board and mince the small garlic cloves and bird's eye chili.
- Take out a bowl and pour in the peanut oil.
- Heat the oil and add the other spices and scallions. Once the spices turn brown, remove and discard them.
- Take out a wok and transfer the oil from the bowl into it. Heat for 2 minutes (heat rapeseed oil until it smokes).
- At this point, the bowl should be empty.
- Add the dried chili flakes, white sesame seeds, minced garlic, bird's eye chili, salt, five-spice powder, and tsaoko fruit to the empty bowl as "seasonings".
- Turn off the heat and let the oil cool down to 210°C (410°F).
- Pour the hot oil from the wok into the bowl and stir well with a spoon (for extra spiciness, you can add another bowl of the same "seasonings" at 165°C (329°F) and mix them together at the end).
- After pouring in the hot oil, stir briefly and then add the white vinegar. It will start to sizzle again. Continue stirring; the white vinegar enhances the aroma.
- Once the chili oil has cooled to lukewarm, add the sugar and MSG (optional). Sugar can soften the spiciness and make it less pungent.

## Additional Information

- Adding five-spice powder and tsaoko fruit as "seasonings" can enhance the fragrance and make the chili oil more aromatic.
