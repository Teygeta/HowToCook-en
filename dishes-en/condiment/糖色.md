# Sugar Color Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Sugar (choose one):
  - Rock sugar: produces the most vibrant and bright color; must be stir-fried with water and oil; melting without water will be very slow.
  - Granulated sugar: must be stir-fried with water and oil; melting without water will be very slow.
  - Powdered sugar: can be used without water.
- The heat during the sugar color process should not be too high! If the induction cooker temperature is insufficient, it will become bitter if overcooked, and not sweet enough if undercooked.

## Measurements

- Oil: 100ml
- Boiling water: 500ml
- Sugar (using rock sugar as an example)

## Instructions

- Turn on the heat and pour 100ml of boiling water into the pot.
- Immediately add 100ml of oil to the pot, trying to keep the time between the two steps as short as possible; you can use high heat if in a hurry.
- Add the rock sugar (if the rock sugar is too clumped, you can crush it beforehand; the lower the clumping, the better).
- Adjust the heat to medium.
- Start stirring:
  - Keep stirring continuously until it turns brown; at this point, **reduce to low heat**.
  - It will become thinner, change to a reddish-brown color, and then form small bubbles; be ready to execute the next step (either operation 1 or operation 2).
  - The small bubbles will gradually disappear, and then large bubbles will appear; when large bubbles appear, the sugar color is complete.
  - You need to quickly proceed to the next step (regardless of which operation, be sure to prepare in advance and act quickly! Otherwise, it will become bitter if overcooked), choosing based on the dish type and personal taste:
    - Operation 1: You can directly add 400ml of boiling water to cool it down.
    - Operation 2: You can also add seasonings like green onions, ginger, garlic, and Sichuan pepper for stir-frying.
