## Measurements

- Eggs: 400g (about 8 pieces)

- Bay leaves: 0.5-1g (about 2 pieces)
- Cinnamon: 3g (1 small piece)

Use the above conditions to calculate the proportion of raw materials to be used in the plan.

## Instructions

- Boil the eggs in cold water for about 8 minutes on high heat (adjust based on your kitchen equipment).
- Remove the eggs and cool them in cold water.
- Gently crack the eggs against each other to create cracks in the shells.
- Place the eggs back in the pot, adding star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, fennel, rock sugar, black tea, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and salt.
- Add water until the eggs are submerged.
- Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce to medium-low heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

> After simmering for 15 minutes, remove the spices; letting the eggs soak a bit longer enhances the flavor.

## Additional Notes

- Cooling the eggs in cold water helps create a gap between the egg and the shell.
- Salt can be adjusted according to personal taste.
- If you don't have all the spices (star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, fennel, rock sugar), you can buy ready-made marinating spice packs.
