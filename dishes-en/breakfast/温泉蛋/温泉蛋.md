### Remarks

- If using a mechanical thermometer (no power required), the probe must be submerged in water at least 6cm; if using an electronic thermometer, there are no special requirements.
- A slightly thicker pot is recommended for better temperature control.
- Although 70 degrees Celsius for 25 minutes is sufficient to kill salmonella, it is still advisable to consume less or purchase eggs that are safe to eat raw.
