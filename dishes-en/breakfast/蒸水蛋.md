## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Fresh eggs
- Hot water
- Aluminum foil or plastic wrap

## Measurements

- 2 eggs
- Salt: 2g
- Hot water: 260ml

## Instructions

- Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them.

- Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to the lowest heat and steam for 4 minutes.
