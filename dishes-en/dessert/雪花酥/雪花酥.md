- After stirring until the temperature drops to a temperature that the hand can touch, put on disposable plastic gloves, rub in the pot or pick up and pull with both hands to evenly disperse the biscuit mixed nuts and marshmallow butter milk powder mixture.
- Press the above mixture into the mold, compact the corners, flatten with a rolling pin, and press the unfilled side into a straight edge as much as possible by hand
