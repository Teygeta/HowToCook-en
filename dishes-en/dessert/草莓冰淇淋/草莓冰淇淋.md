# How to Make Strawberry Ice Cream

Strawberry ice cream is a simple but delicious ice cream, and you can make many different flavors. This time, we will use seasonal fresh strawberries to make delicious, **no-churn** strawberry ice cream.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Sweetened condensed milk
- Strawberries
- Heavy cream
- Vanilla extract
- Ice cream mold (optional)

## Calculation

One serving:

- Strawberry syrup:
    - Strawberries 500 g
    - Granulated sugar 45 g
    - Vanilla extract 1 g
    - Salt 1 g
- Ice cream base:
    - Vanilla extract 5 g
    - Salt 1 g
    - Heavy cream 6 g
    - Sweetened condensed milk 400 g

## Instructions

- First make the strawberry syrup. Wash the strawberries and remove the top leaves. Cut the strawberries into small **5mm** pieces. Reserve half of the chopped strawberries to fold into the ice cream later.
- Put the other half of the chopped strawberries and sugar into a saucepan. Stir and cook over medium heat until the strawberries release liquid and form a syrup in the pan.
- Let the strawberries heat in the syrup, stirring occasionally, until they break down and deform, and the syrup thickens slightly.
- When the syrup stays separated for **3 seconds**, it is ready. Remove the syrup from the heat, add vanilla and salt and stir. Set the strawberry syrup aside to cool.
- While the syrup is cooling, prepare the ice cream base. Add sweetened condensed milk, heavy cream, vanilla extract and salt to a bowl. Use a hand mixer to whip the mixture until it is light and fluffy and forms soft peaks.
- Fold the reserved chopped fresh strawberries into the ice cream base. Transfer the raw ice cream base to a freezer-safe container. Drizzle the cooled strawberry syrup over the ice cream, then gently swirl it into the mixture.
- Cover the ice cream and freeze for **eight hours** before scooping and serving.
