## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Heavy cream

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 3-6 people.

Per serving:

- Heavy cream 200g
- Sugar 40g
- Plain yogurt 250g
- Gelatin sheets 6g

## Instructions

- Cut the gelatin sheets into small pieces and soak in cold water
- Put the heavy cream and sugar in a pot and heat to 60 degrees
- Turn off the heat, take the gelatin out of the water, drain the water, add it to the hot heavy cream, and stir well
- Cool the heavy cream to 40 degrees, add the plain yogurt, and stir well
- Pass the mixture obtained in the above steps through a sieve twice
- Dispense into suitable containers and refrigerate for more than 4 hours

## Additional Information

- The traditional version of panna cotta only uses heavy cream and has more sugar, which is relatively sweet. This version has been improved and is less burdensome to eat.
