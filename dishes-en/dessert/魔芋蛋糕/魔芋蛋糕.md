## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Tools

* Oven
* Electric mixer
* Metal cake mold (any shape)
* Baking paper
* Table knife (for folding and smoothing the cake batter)
* Insulated gloves
* [Optional] Egg separator

### Ingredients

* Eggs
* Erythritol
* Cocoa powder
* Konjac flour
* Cream of tartar

## Calculation

Per serving (9.25 × 5 × 1 inches):

* 3 eggs
* Erythritol 50g
* Cocoa powder 10g
* Konjac flour 10g
* Cream of tartar 1g

## Instructions

### Preheat oven

* Before preparing the cake batter, you can start preheating the oven to 350 ℉ (150 ℃) to save time

### Preliminary Separation

* Remove fresh eggs from the refrigerator
* Prepare two containers and dry them, placing the egg whites and yolks separately
* The container for the egg whites can have a few water droplets, but **must not have any oil**; the container for the egg yolks must not have any water droplets
* Crack the eggs, manually or using an egg separator, and separate the egg whites and yolks into two containers.
* During separation, the egg yolks must not break, and **the egg whites must not be mixed with any egg yolk**, otherwise it will seriously affect whipping. (White strands can enter the egg whites without affecting whipping)
* (Note that if you are not using a kitchen machine, the container for the egg whites is also the whipping container. To avoid overflow, do not exceed **1/8** of the container after adding all the egg whites)

### Whipping the Egg Whites

* Add 1g of cream of tartar to the egg whites
* Use a high speed on the whisk to whip the egg whites until they have a *coarse, large bubble state*, add 50g of erythritol
* Use a medium-low speed on the whisk to whip the egg whites to a *“stiff peak”* state (when the whisk head is lifted, there is a short, upright tip; when the container is inverted, the egg whites can stick to the container and not fall down)
* At this time, the degree of egg white whipping has met the requirements
  * The whisk should be as close as possible to the bottom of the container to prevent the surface from being whipped while the bottom remains liquid)

### Mixing Other Ingredients

* Add the separated egg yolks to the whipped egg whites and mix well with a low-speed mixer
* Add **10g cocoa powder** and **10g konjac flour** to the egg whites, first fold in with a table knife, this is because the powder will splash if you stir directly with a mixer
* The folding technique is
  * First, use the spatula in your right hand to insert it into the bottom of the batter from the center of the mixing bowl
  * Scrape towards the 8 o'clock direction until you touch the bowl wall, then scoop up the batter and lift it into the air, then move it back to the center of the bowl and put the batter into the bowl
  * Hold the mixing bowl with your left hand and turn it from 9 o'clock to 7 o'clock, rotating exactly 60 degrees, completing 1 cycle
  * The speed is about 2 strokes per second
  * This method comes from "Ms. Kojima's Cake Classroom". In layman's terms, it is like stir-frying.
* After folding, stir well with a low-speed mixer

### Baking

* Line the mold with baking paper, fitting the bottom and inner walls
* Pour the cake batter into the mold, then smooth it with a table knife, and then shake it a few times to avoid large air bubbles
* Bake for 25 minutes
* After baking, put on insulated gloves and take it out

### Cooling and Demolding

* (Optional) Drop the mold from a high place to shake out the heat
* Invert the mold for 10 minutes to cool the cake
  * Demolding the cake immediately without cooling will damage the cake
  * This operation may be **hot**, be sure to wear insulated gloves
* Demould, cut into pieces with a table knife and serve
