Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Ingredients:
- Gin
- Soda water
- Lemon
- [Cane sugar syrup](../../condiment/蔗糖糖浆/蔗糖糖浆.md)
- Ice cubes
- Fresh greens (optional, for decoration)

### Tools:
- Manual juicer
- Cocktail shaker (optional)

## Calculation

One cup serving, approximately 350ml (including ice):

- Gin 30-40ml
- Soda water 1 can
- Lemon 1
- Cane sugar syrup 30-40g
- Ice cubes 100g

## Instructions

### Lemon Preparation

1. Cut the lemon in half (the knife direction should be perpendicular to the line connecting the head and tail of the lemon) and cut a slice from one half for later use.
2. Cut the lemon in half again, and use a juicer to extract the juice from the resulting four lemon quarters into a container for later use.

### Official Mixing (without cocktail shaker)

1. Choose a cup, preferably a transparent glass with a capacity of 350-400ml.
2. Place 100g of ice cubes at the bottom of the cup.
3. Pour in 30-40ml of gin.
4. Pour in 20ml of lemon juice (add more if you prefer it sour).
5. Pour in 30-40g of cane sugar syrup.
6. Stir well with a spoon.
7. Place the prepared lemon slice in the cup.
8. Slowly pour soda water along the wall of the cup until full (avoid pouring directly onto the ice to prevent losing bubbles).
9. Gently stir the liquid up and down with a spoon (avoid stirring in a circular motion to prevent losing bubbles).
10. Garnish with fresh greens (optional).

If you have a cocktail shaker, you can replace steps 2-6 with the following:

1. Add ice cubes, gin, lemon juice, and cane sugar syrup into the shaker and shake well.
2. Pour the shaken mixture into the cup (if the ice is too crushed, you can choose to strain out the ice and add fresh ice to the cup).
