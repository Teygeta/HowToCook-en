## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Ingredients:
- Water
- Jujube
- Dried plums
- Hawthorn slices (fresh)
- Yellow rock sugar
- Licorice
- Dried tangerine peel
- Cardamom
- Dried osmanthus

## Calculation

- Two liters of water
- Jujube 25g
- Dried plums 25g
- Yellow rock sugar 100g
- Hawthorn slices 30g
- Licorice 2g
- Dried tangerine peel 4g
- Cardamom 1g
- Dried osmanthus 3g

All quantities can be increased or decreased proportionally.

## Instructions

1. Rinse the ingredients (except for dried osmanthus and rock sugar) and soak them in 1.5 liters of water at room temperature for more than two hours (excluding dried osmanthus and rock sugar).
2. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and then reduce to low heat to simmer for 40 minutes for the first extraction.
3. Place the rock sugar in a bowl, then pour the hot broth over it and stir until the sugar dissolves.
4. Return the herbs to the pot, add 600ml of water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce to medium heat, and simmer for another 20 minutes for the second extraction.
5. Finally, mix the second extraction with the sugar water while still hot. Add dried osmanthus (do not exceed 80°C) and let it cool before refrigerating for more than 3 hours.
6. Remember to strain out the dried osmanthus before drinking. Sip it like tea; it should be cool and refreshing, with a balanced sourness and sweetness, and a rich, lingering flavor.

## Additional Information

It is best to drink it after refrigerating.
