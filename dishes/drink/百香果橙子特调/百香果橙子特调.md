## Essential Ingredients and Tools

### Ingredients:
- Passion fruit
- Orange
- Jasmine green tea leaves or soda water (choose one)
- Granulated sugar
- Ice cubes
- Honey (optional)
- Mint leaves or other greens (optional, for decoration)

### Tools:
- Manual juicer

## Calculation

Based on the jasmine green tea version, one cup serving is approximately 380ml:

- 1 orange (about 200g, fist-sized)
- 3-6g jasmine green tea leaves
- 150ml boiling water
- Over 160g ice cubes

### Marinating Passion Fruit (this is the amount for two servings due to small quantity):

- 3 passion fruits
- 30g granulated sugar
- 10g honey (if not available, can be replaced with 5g granulated sugar)

## Instructions

### Marinating Passion Fruit:

1. Scoop out the pulp of three passion fruits (including the juice) into a container.
2. Weigh 30g of granulated sugar and add it to the container.
3. Weigh 10g of honey and add it (if not available, can be replaced with 5g of granulated sugar).
4. Stir well.
5. Seal the container with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.

### Preparing Jasmine Green Tea:

1. Weigh 3-6g of tea leaves and place them in a container, add 150ml of boiling water, and steep for 6 minutes.
2. Add 90g of ice cubes to the brewed green tea to cool it down, stirring to speed up the cooling process.
3. Once the ice cubes have melted, filter the tea to obtain about 240ml of jasmine green tea.

### Orange Preparation (can be done while brewing tea):

1. Cut the orange in half (the knife direction should be perpendicular to the line connecting the head and tail of the orange) and cut a slice from one half for later use.
2. Cut the orange in half again, and use a juicer to extract the juice from the resulting four orange quarters into a container for later use.

### Official Mixing:

1. Choose a cup, preferably a transparent glass with a capacity of 350-400ml.
2. Place 70g of ice cubes at the bottom of the cup and pour all the orange juice in.
3. Place the prepared orange slice against the inner wall of the cup.
4. Pour the marinated passion fruit over the ice.
5. Slowly pour the jasmine green tea until the cup is full, allowing for layering.
6. Garnish with mint leaves (optional).

Stir well before enjoying.
