## Additional Information

- After adding boiling water, try to keep the inside of the cup warm, such as using a cup with a smaller opening or covering it with a lid. If the temperature is low, using a measuring cup to measure may cause the boiling water to cool down before pouring into the black tea, so you can estimate its volume directly without using a measuring cup.
- After the waiting time is over, you can lift or stir the tea bag to make the brewing more even.
