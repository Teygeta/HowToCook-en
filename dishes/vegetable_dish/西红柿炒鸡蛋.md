## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Tomato
* Egg
* Cooking oil
* Salt
* Sugar (optional)

Total amount:

* Tomato = 1 (about 180g) * number of servings
* Egg = 1.5 * number of servings, rounded up
* Cooking oil = 4ml * eggs/piece
* Salt = 1.5-2g * number of servings
* Sugar = 0-2g * number of servings
* Scallion = 0-10g * number of servings

## Operation

- Wash the tomatoes
- Optional: Remove the skin of the tomato
  - Scald the skin with boiling water, then put the tomato in cold water and peel off the skin
- Remove the stem of the tomato and cut it into small pieces with sides no more than 4cm, which is `tomato pieces`
- Crack the eggs into a bowl, add `1g * number of servings` of salt, and stir well to make `egg liquid`
  - You can consider adding 1ml of vinegar to the eggs, which can remove the fishy smell and make the eggs more fluffy
- Heat the pot and add cooking oil
- After the oil is hot, pour in the `egg liquid`. Stir-fry until the eggs solidify and the color is slightly yellow, which is `half-cooked eggs`
- Turn off the heat. Put the `half-cooked eggs` on a plate and turn on the heat again
  - Note: Do not wash the pot
- Add `tomato pieces`, pat and stir-fry with a spatula for 20 seconds, or until the tomatoes are soft
