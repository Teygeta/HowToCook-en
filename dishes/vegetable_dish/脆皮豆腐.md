- Heat the pot, add 18ml of cooking oil to the pot. Wait 10 seconds for the oil temperature to rise
- Put the old tofu slices coated with egg liquid evenly into the pot, spread them on the bottom of the pot, and fry over low heat until golden brown, then turn over
- After both sides are fried until golden brown, pour in the sauce, let each piece of tofu bathe in the sauce, cook over high heat for 3 minutes until the sauce thickens
