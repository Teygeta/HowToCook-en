# Stir-fried Cucumber with Eggs and Ham Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Cucumber
- Egg
- Ham sausage
- Salt
- Light soy sauce
- Red pepper (optional)

## Calculation

Determine how many servings you plan to make each time before making. One serving is just enough for 1 person to eat.

Per serving:

- 1 cucumber (about 200g)
- 2 eggs
- 1 ham sausage (about 40g)
- 1 red pepper (optional)
- 10ml cooking oil
- 3ml light soy sauce
- 2g salt

## Operation

- Wash the cucumber and cut it into semi-circular slices, set aside
- Cut the ham into semi-circular slices, set aside
- Chop the red pepper (optional), set aside
- Crack the eggs into a bowl, stir well, which is `egg liquid`
- Pour 5ml of cooking oil into the hot pot
- After the oil is hot, turn to low heat, pour in the beaten `egg liquid`, use chopsticks to scramble, stir-fry until the eggs solidify and the color is slightly yellow, which is `half-cooked eggs`, take them out and set aside
- **No need to wash the pot**, pour 5ml of cooking oil into the pot, pour in the cucumber slices and stir-fry over high heat for **1 minute**
- Pour the `half-cooked eggs` into the pot, add 2g of salt, 3ml of light soy sauce, immediately pour in the ham slices and chili pieces (optional) and stir-fry evenly
- Turn off the heat and serve

## Additional content

- Ham is salty, add it after seasoning, so that the ham will not be covered with salt
