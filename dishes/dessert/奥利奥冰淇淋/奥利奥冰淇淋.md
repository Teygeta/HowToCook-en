# How to Make Oreo Ice Cream

Oreo ice cream is a simple yet delicious dessert, with an estimated preparation time of about 30 minutes (mainly spent on whipping the cream and removing the Oreo filling).

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Heavy cream (recommended brand: Anchor)
- Original Oreo cookies
- Electric mixer
- A container with a capacity of over 600ml and a small diameter (Note: Ensure it can accommodate the electric mixer)
- Small knife (or a tool to remove the filling)
- Ice cream molds (optional)

## Calculation

Per serving:

- 6 Oreo cookies
- 18 grams of granulated sugar
- 250ml heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Twist open the Oreos and remove the filling, setting it aside.
2. Crush the Oreo cookies with chopsticks, ensuring that half of the cookies turn into powder and the other half are crushed to a maximum length of less than 0.5 cm (you can search for "Oreo cookie crumbs" online to save time and effort).
3. Pour all the cream into the deep container and add the prepared sugar.
4. Start whipping with the electric mixer on high speed until the cream holds a peak (0.5 cm - 1 cm) and does not drip like liquid (some dripping is normal).
5. Once whipped, add the crushed Oreos to the cream and mix until the Oreos are evenly distributed.
6. Optional: Pour the mixture into ice cream molds.
7. Place in the freezer (-18 degrees) for at least 4 hours.

## Additional Information

- Be careful not to use fragile containers when crushing the Oreos.
- Take care not to cut yourself when removing the Oreo filling.
