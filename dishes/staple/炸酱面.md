# Noodles with Savory Soybean Paste Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   Diced meat/minced meat
*   Dried noodles
*   Garlic
*   Cabbage
*   Soybean paste
*   Sweet bean sauce

## Calculation

You need to determine how many servings you plan to make before each production. One serving is enough for 1 person.

Total amount:

*   Diced meat/minced meat = servings * 150g
*   Dried noodles = servings * 150g
*   Garlic = servings * 3 cloves
*   Cabbage = servings * 3 leaves
*   Oil = servings * 10g
*   Soybean paste = servings * 15g
*   Sweet bean sauce = servings * 15g

## Operation

1.  Shred the cabbage (or other vegetables) and blanch it until softened and cooked through. Set aside.
2.  Cook the noodles until they are断生 (断生) (cooked but still firm) (no white core). Set aside with the soup.
3.  Mince the garlic. Heat the oil in a pot, add minced garlic and meat, and stir-fry until the meat is completely cooked (no red color).
4.  Add soybean paste and sweet bean sauce, add 30g of water, cover and simmer until the sauce is reduced and thickened to get炸酱 (炸酱) (savory soybean paste).
5.  Pour out the soup from the noodles in step 2, put them in a bowl, add the vegetables from step 1 and the炸酱 (炸酱) (savory soybean paste) from step 4, mix well and eat.

## Additional Content

*   Lean diced meat is recommended for a better taste. Buy more at once, divide it into small fresh-keeping bags, and freeze it for later use. Thaw it in the microwave for 30 seconds before each use.
*   The key to the taste of noodles is劲道 (劲道) (chewiness). Do not choose thin noodles such as Longxu noodles. Do not cook them completely in step 2. When serving and performing subsequent steps, the soup will further催熟 (催熟) (ripen) them.
*   This article uses cabbage as an example, but you can flexibly replace it with various easily available vegetables. The taste is not greatly affected, and half a bowl is appropriate.
*   If conditions permit (another pot) and you are skilled, steps 1 and 2 and steps 3 and 4 can be performed in parallel at different times.
*   You can optionally add dried chilies (= servings * 3) in steps 3/4.
*   Personal preferences vary for sweet and salty tastes, and the ratio of the two sauces needs to be iteratively optimized by yourself.
