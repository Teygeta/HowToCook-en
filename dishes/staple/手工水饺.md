- Ginger 3g
- Scallions 15g
- Salt 3g

- 1 egg

## Operation

### Make dumpling skin

- Add all the flour to the basin
- Add sesame oil
- Dig a small hole in the center of the flour
- Add water 4-5 times and stir. When small, crumbly, slightly dry dough appears
- Cancel adding water and press the dough firmly with your hands
- Press the dough firmly until the flour around the basin can be incorporated. This step is to make the surface of the dough smooth and the basin clean.
- Place the dough on the table, turn the basin upside down on the table, and let the dough rest for about 45 minutes at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees.
- After the dough has rested, knead it into a strip, combine it into a ball, and knead it into a strip again. Repeat 3 times
- Roll into a strip, cut into 20 evenly sized doughs, and rub them into balls with a diameter of about 3-3.5cm
- Flatten the dough, sprinkle flour on your hands, the table, the rolling pin, and the dough to prevent the dough from sticking
- Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, about 8cm in diameter and about 2mm thick, slightly thicker in the middle than around

### Mix the filling

- Remove the skin from the pork, keep some fat, and cut into small pieces
- Use a kitchen knife (two are recommended) to chop the pork into minced meat and put it in a bowl
- Chop the scallions and ginger into minced pieces, add them to the meat bowl and stir well
- Wash the chives and cut them short to a length of less than 3mm
- Mix the chives and minced meat, add 2ml of oyster sauce, light soy sauce, and sesame oil each, add an egg white, and mix well by hand
- Let it sit for 30 minutes before you can start making dumplings

### Wrap dumplings

- Put the dough on your left hand, and try not to get flour on the side of the dumpling filling to prevent it from closing
- Use chopsticks to夹 (夹) about 1/2 the diameter of the dough
- Close and pinch along the circumference of the dumpling skin. There is no need to pinch flowers for personal consumption, just make sure the dumpling skin does not leak.

### Cook dumplings

- Use a pot that can hold 20 dumplings, or cook in batches
- Boil water, the water is about 3/4 the height of the pot
- After the water boils over high heat, add the dumplings and adjust to medium heat
- The first time you add the dumplings and the water bubbles, add 50ml of cold water to the side of the pot (repeat this step twice)
- After the third time the water boils, add 50ml of cold water, turn to low heat and wait for 60s before serving

## Additional Content

- There is no need to cover the pot when cooking dumplings. Adding water three times is to prevent the dumplings from being in a constant boiling state, which will cause the surface to break and turn into dough pieces.
