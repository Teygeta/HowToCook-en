# Pancake Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   Oil
*   Flour
*   Electric baking pan

## Calculation

Note: This staple food does not provide fewer or more versions. Here, the amount most suitable for novices is selected:

*   Flour = 400g
*   Hot water = 130ml (80 degrees)
*   Cold water = 130ml

## Operation

*   Pour 400g of flour into a basin, mix half with cold water and half with hot water, stir into flour絮 (絮) (flocs), and knead into a团 (团) (ball) with your hands. Seal with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 40 minutes
*   When there are 10 minutes left before the end of the resting time, please check the酥 (酥) (crisp) oil method in[Tips](../../condiment/油酥.md) (hot oil酥 (酥) (crisp) has a better effect)
*   Do not knead the rested dough, press it slightly, and use a horizontal knife and a vertical knife to divide it into four parts.
*   Rub it round, roll it out, and roll it into a pancake about the size of an electric baking pan. Take 1/4 of the酥 (酥) (crisp) oil and spread it evenly on the surface of the pancake
*   Cut along the radius of the pancake, roll it into a cone shape from the outer circle, and then pinch the tail of the cone to prevent the酥 (酥) (crisp) oil from leaking out.
*   Press the tip of the dough cone, flatten it, and then roll it again into a pancake about the size of the electric baking pan (about 3mm thick)
*   Preheat the electric baking pan, apply cold oil (heat the pot with cold oil), put the rolled pancake into the electric baking pan, brush some oil on the top of the pancake, spread evenly (lock in moisture), and cover the lid
*   Bake for one minute on high heat, open the lid, turn the pancake over and bake for another minute
*   Repeat the above actions to complete the baking of the pancake
