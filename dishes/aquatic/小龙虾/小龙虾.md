## Additional Notes

Restaurants should deep-fry it once, but it is too wasteful for home frying, so in this recipe, use more oil than stir-frying oil and fry it a little. The actual test is also delicious.

The shrimp meat after removing the shrimp line has a slightly worse taste than the shrimp meat without the shrimp line, and removing the shrimp line from the crayfish is a challenge for novices. It is also possible not to remove the shrimp line if you can accept the shrimp line.
