- After the sea bass is processed, wash it clean, wipe it dry with kitchen paper, make a few cuts on both sides, wash off the mucus on the fish with salt, and spread 10g of salt all over the inside and outside of the fish, and marinate for more than 10 minutes.

## Additional Notes

- Technical summary:
  - This dish can be made with your hands. The key point is the heat. The size of the fish is related to the heat. Too long will cause the fish to be too old and extremely affect the taste, and too short will cause some of the fish to be uncooked. Therefore, steaming fish over high heat is generally better within 10 minutes.
  - Remember to use chopsticks to separate the plate containing the fish when steaming the fish. There are two benefits to doing this:
    - 1. The fish will drip water onto the plate during the steaming process. If the fish is in direct contact, it will cause the fish to smell fishy when eaten.
    - 2. Can evenly heat the fish.
  - This dish is simple and delicious
