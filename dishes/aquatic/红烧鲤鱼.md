## Instructions

Note: The fish mentioned below is the one that the seller has simply processed, with the scales scraped and the internal organs removed.

- Wash the scallions, ginger, garlic, and dried chilies separately.
- Cut the white part of the scallions into sections, each section about 4cm long, and then split each section into four petals.
- Cut the ginger into slices, each slice about 3mm thick.
- Smash one garlic clove and mince it, and cut the remaining garlic into two cloves.
- Cut the dried chilies into four sections.
- Cut the pork belly into slices, about 4cm*4cm.
- Wash the fish.
- Make a few diagonal cuts on the thick part of the fish back to make it easier to taste
- Pour more oil into the pot and heat it to 70% heat (just starting to smoke), add the fish and fry for 1 minute until the fish skin is slightly hardened, then remove and set aside (be careful not to move the fish as soon as it enters the pot, wait for a while before moving and turning it over), pour out the oil for frying the fish, leaving a little oil in the pot
- Heat the oil in the pot, add the pork belly and sauté until fragrant.
- Add dried chili, scallions, ginger, and garlic cloves and stir-fry for 1 minute.
- Pour the fried fish into the pot.
- Pour along the side of the pot
  - 50ml cooking wine
  - 50ml aged vinegar
  - 50ml Weijixian (umami soy sauce)
  - 20ml dark soy sauce for coloring
  - 5ml oyster sauce to enhance freshness
  - 5g spoonful of salt
  - 50g white sugar
  - Clear water to cover the fish.
- Turn to medium heat and bring the water to a boil.
- Turn to low heat and simmer slowly to let it taste.
- After 15 minutes, open the lid and pick out the scallions, ginger, garlic, and dried chilies in the pot.
- Turn to high heat to collect the juice. When 1/4 of the soup remains, sprinkle some minced garlic, turn off the heat and serve.
- Braised carp is out of the pot!

## Additional Notes

The reasons for adding pork belly to braised carp are as follows:

- The pork belly will produce lard when it is stir-fried. Compared with vegetable oil, animal fat is more fragrant.
- The stir-fried golden pork belly is also very fragrant after being stewed, which is equivalent to side dishes.
- Fish itself has less fat content, so it lacks fragrance, and the focus is on the taste of the meat. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use lard for fish dishes if you want a pot of milky white and mellow fish soup. Lard is the best choice~
