It is convenient to make chicken wings with an air fryer. This kind of food with its own oil tastes very good. It is better than KFC, and you don’t **need to wash dishes and pots** after eating.

*   Cooking time: 40 minutes (3 minutes preparation + 20 minutes thawing + 17 minutes in the pot)
*   Actual operation time: 5 minutes

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   Required: Chicken wings (recommended to buy Tyson's Orleans chicken wings, JD is more than 30 yuan a bag of 454g about 12 pieces if JD is on sale. I have also bought Shangxian and Shengnong's, but they are not as convenient as this. Tyson's are marinated, if you have time, you can buy unmarinated ones and marinate them yourself.)
*   Optional: Dried basil (sprinkling it is purely for good looks)
*   Optional: Yunnan Danshan dipping water (instead of barbecue sauce)

## Calculation

*   6 chicken wings (Tyson Orleans chicken wings, other brands such as Shengnong Dudu wings may be larger, please consider according to your food intake)

## Operation

*   Take the chicken wings out of the refrigerator, put the chicken wings face down in a tin foil baking tray, sprinkle with dried basil, cover with plastic wrap and thaw naturally for 20 minutes
*   Sprinkle with dried basil, air fryer 200°C, 10 minutes
*   Turn over, sprinkle with dried basil, air fryer 200°C, 7 minutes
