# How to Cook French Fries

![French Fries](./炸薯条.jpg)

French fries 🍟 are a fast food made by frying potatoes 🥔 (in some countries it may not be considered fast food), which is very suitable. Compared with frying, air fryer may be easier to avoid collapse and achieve asynchronous non-blocking. Compared with cutting potatoes by yourself, washing away the starch and spraying oil, using semi-finished fries may significantly reduce the heat consumption before heat intake, which is equivalent to significantly reducing the heat consumption ~~before heat intake~~.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   1 bag of semi-finished fries (recommended brand McCain)
*   1 air fryer (if you like crispy ones, avoid small brands)

> Note that there may be different ways to make French fries depending on the cooking tools used. This article only introduces the method of using an "air fryer".

## Calculation

*   As a staple food, 400g per person per meal (based on semi-finished products)
*   As a snack, 1/4 of the staple food quality +-50g per person per meal

> Use the above conditions to calculate the amount of materials according to your needs (including but not limited to daily food intake, mood, and pre-meal exercise).

## Operation

### Unpack Fries

*   When opening a large amount of semi-finished fries, pay attention to making the opening small, which can effectively reduce the frosting on the surface of the fries under long-term storage.

### Preheat Air Fryer

*   Plug in, preheat at 200℃ for 5 minutes.
*   The purpose of preheating is to ensure that the temperature in the pot is already at the temperature required for cooking when the ingredients are put in.
*   Note that you should take out the fries after preheating, and should not wait for the fries to soften before frying.

### Fry Fries

*   Take out the fries and put them in the air fryer, 200℃ for 20 minutes.
*   When taking out the fries, pay attention that the semi-finished fries already have oil, so if you want to asynchronously do knife-style things in the client, you need to use clamping tools.
*   You can take out the pot and shake it every 5~10 minutes to make the fries heat evenly and prevent sticking.

### Crisp (Optional)

*   At 10 minutes to 15 minutes, take out the pot and spray a layer of oil with an area of 2/3 of the surface area of the fries on the surface of the dried fries.

### Take Out & Plate

*   If you like crispy fries, take them out and dance with the pot so that air passes over the surface of the fries before plating; if you like soft fries, plate them directly. It is better to serve with dipping sauce or pour sauce on top.

## Additional Content

*   Ketchup, mayonnaise, honey mustard sauce, [garlic soy sauce](../../condiment/蒜香酱油.md)... The advancement path of French fries lies in the exploration of sauces and sauce combinations.
