# How to Make Tomato Beef Brisket

Tomato beef brisket has a thick, sweet and sour soup, and the beef is soft and mellow, which is a perfect match with rice. Generally, beginners need 90 minutes to complete.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Tomatoes
* Beef brisket
* Gas stove (for peeling tomatoes)
* Pressure cooker/casserole/ordinary aluminum pot (iron pot)
* 2cm two sections of scallion, two slices of ginger, 10g each of chopped green onion and ginger
* Light soy sauce, white pepper powder, white sugar, cooking/yellow wine, three small pieces of star anise
* Beef brisket (selecting a combination of fat and lean will taste better)

## Calculation

Per serving:

- 3-4 tomatoes (about 200g each)
- 500g beef brisket
- 20-30ml cooking oil

## Operation

- Cut the beef brisket into strips and cubes with a length, width, and height of 2cm. Put it in cold water, bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes to remove the blood. Remove and rinse clean.
- Start another pot with 2L of boiling water, add 2cm two sections of scallion, two slices of ginger, star anise, 5-10ml cooking/yellow wine, put in the blanched beef, cover and stew (casserole for 1 hour, pressure cooker for 45 minutes in meat stew mode). It is proved that it is stewed well when the chopsticks can easily penetrate it
- Peel the tomatoes: slide a cross on the head of the tomato to the waistline, poke into the fruit stem with chopsticks/forks, use a small fire on the gas stove, rotate and bake, take it down to check in time, peel it off after the skin is peeled off, and cut it into pieces. The smaller the better
  - Be careful of burns when peeling, and the peeled tomatoes are particularly slippery, so cut slowly and pay attention to safety
- Heat the pot and add oil, the oil temperature is 70% hot, add 10g each of chopped green onion and ginger, put the tomatoes into the pot, stir-fry until the tomato is red, add the cooked beef brisket and the original soup, the original soup just covers the beef
- Add salt, sugar, and light soy sauce to taste according to personal taste and cover
- Continue to stir-fry over high heat for 3-5 minutes after boiling
- Turn off the heat when the tomato juice is moderately viscous, sprinkle in the chopped green onion, and serve

- The tomato peeling method in the tutorial is the fastest method I have practiced so far
- Absolutely do not use tomato sauce and add less seasoning, try to restore the original flavor of the ingredients as much as possible
