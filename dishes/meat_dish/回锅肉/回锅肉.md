# How to Make Twice Cooked Pork

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Pork belly
- Scallions
- Ginger
- Green and red peppers
- Garlic sprouts
- Cooking wine
- Doubanjiang
- Light soy sauce
- Monosodium glutamate

## Calculation

- The amount of pork belly is 0.5 jin/man 0.3 jin/woman (authentic twice-cooked pork is made with Erdao meat [commonly known as: hip tip], which has firm meat and a suitable ratio of fat to lean)
- Small onion 2
- Ginger 10-40g
- Green and red peppers (choose according to your tolerance for spiciness, 0-30g)
- Garlic sprouts 1 handful
- Cooking wine 5ml
- Doubanjiang 10ml
- Monosodium glutamate 5g
- Light soy sauce 5ml

## Operation

### First stage processing of pork belly

- Heat the pot and press the pork belly tightly on the pot with your hands to scorch the skin
  - This step is to treat the sweat glands on the pig skin (or ask the master to burn the skin when buying meat, you can ignore it if you like sweat glands)
- Wash the skin with a steel wire ball, if it is not washed clean, it will have a bitter taste
- Put the pork belly in a pot, add water to submerge the pork belly, add ginger slices, cooking wine and small onion (take 2 small onions and tie them into a knot)
- Bring to a boil over high heat, skim off the foam after the water boils, and continue to cook for 15 minutes, until the lean meat part can be easily pierced with chopsticks

### Side dish processing

- Cut the green and red peppers into circles
- Cut the garlic sprouts into sections
- Cut the ginger into thin slices
- Mix 5ml of Doubanjiang and 5ml of light soy sauce in advance

### Second stage processing of pork belly

- Take out the cooked pork belly and put it in cold water to cool
- Wipe the water off the pork belly and cut it into thin slices of 2mm with fat on top and lean on the bottom (if it is cut too thick, the taste will not be good and it will be very greasy)

### Start stir-frying the meat

Note that this step requires **quick operation, be careful not to burn the pot**

1. Heat the pot, add a layer of base oil to heat the pot
2. Add the pork belly and stir-fry until the fat becomes transparent and the meat slices are slightly curled (the effect of Erdao meat is the best).
3. Pour in the Doubanjiang and light soy sauce mixture, stir-fry for 15 seconds
4. Add the green and red pepper rings and small ginger slices, add another 5ml of Doubanjiang and stir-fry for 30 seconds
5. Add garlic sprouts and stir-fry for 60 seconds
6. Remove from the pot

### Simple version

- Select frozen pork belly and place it at room temperature for 0.5 hours or put fresh pork belly in the refrigerator for 1 hour, and cut it into 2-5 mm thin slices
- Turn on medium heat, dry-fry the chili peppers in the pot for 30-45 seconds and take them out
- Heat the pot, add a layer of base oil to heat the pot, add ginger slices and stir-fry for 15 seconds
- Pour in the pork belly, stir-fry once every 10 seconds, wait until the pork belly turns golden brown (the longer the stir-frying time, the harder the pork belly will taste)
- Pour in the previously dry-fried chili peppers, season with light soy sauce, and continue to stir-fry for 60 seconds
- Remove from the pot

## Additional content

- If you don’t like garlic sprouts, you can replace them with onions or other vegetables, but you should pay attention to the ease of cooking of the vegetables and stir-fry the vegetables in advance, otherwise the vegetables will be half-cooked
- If the twice-cooked pork is relatively large, you can cut it into 5 cm square pieces, and cook the pork belly until the chopsticks can be easily inserted into the pork skin
- The meat will be firmer after the twice-cooked pork is cooled in cold water
- Wiping the water off the twice-cooked pork is to avoid splashing oil and injury during stir-frying
- Remember not to cut the twice-cooked pork too thickly, otherwise it will be very greasy
