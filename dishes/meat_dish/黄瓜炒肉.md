# How to Make Cucumber Fried Pork

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

* Cucumber
* Lean pork
* Cooking oil
* Light soy sauce
* Salt
* Garlic
* Millet chili

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 1 person to eat

Total amount:

* Cucumber = 100 grams * number of servings
* Pork = 50 grams * number of servings
* Oil = 50 grams * number of servings
* Salt = 10 grams * number of servings
* Soy sauce = 5 grams * number of servings
* Garlic cloves = 2 cloves * number of servings
* Millet chili = 1 * number of servings

## Operation

* Cut the lean pork into slices, put it in a bowl, pour in 10 grams of cooking oil, light soy sauce, stir evenly, and marinate for 10 minutes
* Cut off 5 cm of the head and tail of the cucumber, and cut the remaining part diagonally into 0.5 cm thin slices
* Pour the cucumber into a bowl, sprinkle 8 grams of salt, stir evenly, and marinate for 5 minutes
* Peel the garlic cloves, flatten them, and cut them into minced garlic for later use
* Remove the stems of the millet chili and cut them into even 0.5 cm sections
* Heat the pot, pour in 40 grams of oil, wait for the oil temperature to smoke, add minced garlic and millet chili and stir-fry 5 times
* Add the marinated lean pork and stir-fry until the meat is cooked and discolored
* Add the cucumber, add 2 grams of salt, stir-fry evenly over high heat for half a minute, and remove from the pot
  * If you cannot guarantee high heat, it may be a little raw. You can consider increasing it to 50 seconds.
