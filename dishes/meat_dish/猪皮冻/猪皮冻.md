## Additional content

- During operation, you need to pay attention that if you make pig skin jelly, it will be "waste" if you put it directly into the pot to cook, which is also the most taboo. Be sure to rub the pig skin continuously with white vinegar and salt, so as to ensure that the cooked pig skin is crystal clear and has no fishy smell
