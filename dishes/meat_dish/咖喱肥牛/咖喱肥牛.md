![Curry Beef Finished Product](./咖喱肥牛.jpg)

Curry beef is delicious, nutritious and suitable for serving with rice. It is quite delicious to eat a curry beef after eating too many stir-fried dishes.

Suitable for eating at home or making into a bento to take to the company to eat (microwave heating will not have too much taste~).

And there are few materials required, easy to buy, and novices can get out of the pot in about 40 minutes.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Bay leaf
- Pure milk (Weigang fresh milk is recommended)
- Onion
- Carrot
- Potato
- Fatty beef roll
- Curry block

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 2 people to eat.

Per serving:

- Bay leaf 1 piece
- Pure milk 50ml
- Onion 100g
- Carrot 150g
- Potato 200g (quite filling, add as appropriate)
- Fatty beef roll 300g (add more if you like to eat meat)
- Curry block 2 pieces (about 100g)

## Operation

- Cut the onion into strips, and cut the carrots and potatoes into pieces for later use
- Boil a pot of boiling water, put the fatty beef roll into the pot when the water boils, scoop out the blood foam and drain the water aside for later use
- Heat the pot, add 10ml - 15ml of cooking oil to the pot, **wait 10 seconds for the oil temperature to rise**
- Add onion and stir-fry until the onion becomes soft and transparent
- Add potatoes and carrots and **stir-fry for 2 minutes**
- Add cold water until it covers all the ingredients
- Put the bay leaf and curry cubes into the pot, cover the pot, **wait for the water to boil, reduce the heat and wait until the potato cubes and carrot cubes are stewed until soft (you can confirm with chopsticks)**
- Add the fatty beef roll and milk, cover the pot and simmer over low heat for another 2-3 minutes before serving (stir the ingredients with a spoon, pay attention to the strength to avoid breaking the fatty beef roll)

## Additional content

- No need to crush the curry cubes, just put the whole cubes in.
- When operating, you need to pay attention to stirring the ingredients to avoid uneven seasoning of the ingredients.
