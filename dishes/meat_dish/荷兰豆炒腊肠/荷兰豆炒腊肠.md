- Chinese sausage
- Light soy sauce
- Cooking oil

## Calculation

The following is for one serving.

Per serving:

- Approximately 50 snow peas
- Approximately 100 g of Chinese sausage
- 10ml of cooking oil
- 10ml of light soy sauce

## Operation

- Remove the stems from the snow peas, and if you have time, you can also remove the ends at the same time.

- Before buying Chinese sausage, you can ask the owner whether it is raw or cooked. If it is raw, you need to steam it in advance. If it is cooked, you can use it directly.

- Wash the snow peas, then blanch them in water for about 45 seconds. Blanch the snow peas until they change color, then remove them and rinse them in cold water for later use.

- Heat the pot and add about 10ml of cooking oil to the pot. Wait 10 seconds for the oil temperature to rise.

- Add the Chinese sausage, keep stir-frying until the Chinese sausage is *slightly curled*, pay attention here to **keep the heat low**, as low as possible, otherwise it will easily burn.

- Add the snow peas, turn to medium-high heat, stir-fry for 30 seconds, add light soy sauce, and then stir-fry for another 20-30 seconds.

## Additional content

- No salt was added during the production process, because the Chinese sausage itself will have some flavor, and light soy sauce will also have some saltiness.
- Although Chinese sausage tastes good, it is an unhealthy food, so it is recommended to add less.
