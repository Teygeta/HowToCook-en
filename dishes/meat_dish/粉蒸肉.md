## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is just enough for 3 people to eat.

Per serving:

- Pork belly 250g
- Steamed pork rice flour 50g
- Light soy sauce 7.5ml
- Dark soy sauce 5ml
- Cooking wine 7.5ml
- Pixian Doubanjiang 5g (optional)
- Minced ginger 5g
- Minced garlic 5g
- White sugar 2.5g
- Potatoes or pumpkin 150g
- Steamer water 1000ml

## Operation

- Wash the pork belly and cut it into slices about 5cm long, 3cm wide, and 0.5cm thick
- Chop the ginger and garlic into fine pieces with a particle diameter of no more than 1mm
- Take a large bowl, put in the cut pork belly, 15ml light soy sauce, 10ml dark soy sauce, 15ml cooking wine, 10g Pixian Doubanjiang, 10g minced ginger, 10g minced garlic, 5g white sugar
- Stir well with chopsticks, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature (20°C - 25°C) to marinate for 30 minutes
- After marinating, add 100g of steamed pork rice flour and continue to stir for 2 minutes to ensure that each piece of meat is evenly coated with flour
- Peel the potatoes, control the slice thickness at 0.8cm, the slice area is about 5cm x 5cm, and the weight is controlled at 300g
- Spread the potato slices on the bottom of a deep bowl with a diameter of 20cm, try to avoid overlapping
- Spread the pork belly mixed with flour evenly on the potato slices and press firmly
- Add 2000ml of clear water to the steamer and heat to a continuous bubbling surface (100°C)
- Put the bowl filled with ingredients into the steamer and cover the pot
- Keep steaming over medium heat for 60 minutes (keep the heat at a sustainable boiling level, about 600W thermal power)
- After the time is up, insert chopsticks into the center of the meat. If it can be easily penetrated without obvious resistance, it means it is steamed
- If this state is not reached, continue heating for 10-15 minutes until the meat is soft and rotten and the oil seeps out
- Take out and serve

## Additional content

- If you need to make rice flour by yourself, you can put 150g of rice in a pot and stir-fry over medium-low heat until slightly yellow (about 8 minutes), then add 1g of dried chili, 1g of peppercorns, and 0.5g of star anise, stir-fry until fragrant, then crush with a food processor, sieve and set aside
- If the water level is lower than 1cm from the bottom of the pot during steaming, add 500ml of hot water (above 90°C) immediately to maintain sufficient steam
