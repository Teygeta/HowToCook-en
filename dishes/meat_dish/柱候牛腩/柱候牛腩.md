- Choose the time for stewing the meat according to the pot used:

  - a. Ordinary stew pot: simmer over low heat for 3 hours
  - b. Pressure cooker: pressure for 40 minutes

- After the time is up, open the lid and season. If it is not salty enough, add salt or light soy sauce (add a small amount and taste it continuously until it is suitable), and add sugar if it is not sweet enough.
- After adjusting the taste, take out the beef brisket first
- If you want to eat radish and potatoes, peel them and cut them into 2cm thick slices and pour them into the pot and cook for 10-15 minutes (or cook to the desired taste), if it is a pressure cooker, add pressure and cook for 5 minutes
