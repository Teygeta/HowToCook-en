* Small hot pepper amount is 3/person, 5g each
* Light soy sauce amount is 20 ml/person

## Operation

* First, chop the small hot peppers and put them in a mortar with cumin granules and crush them into granules, which will be more flavorful. If time is tight, skip the crushing step
* Remove the head and seeds of the green pepper (you can skip it if you like spicy food), and cut into shreds. Cut the green onion into sections.
* Thaw the beef in advance, wash it with water, drain it or absorb it with kitchen paper, and cut the beef into slices along the grain
* Then marinate the meat, add light soy sauce, starch, and oil, mix evenly, and let it stand for 30 minutes. For the meat marinating method, please refer to [Learn to Marinate](../../tips/learn/学习腌.md)
* Heat the pot and add oil, add green onion, sauté until fragrant, then add the marinated beef and stir-fry
* After the beef changes color, add cumin chili granules evenly and stir-fry until cooked
* Then add green pepper shreds, add salt after they are broken
* Turn off the heat after stir-frying for 1 minute and stir-fry for another 30 seconds to ensure even heating before serving
