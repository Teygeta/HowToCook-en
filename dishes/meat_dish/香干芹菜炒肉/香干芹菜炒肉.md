## Additional content

- If you haven’t bought celery or the celery you use is relatively thick, you can consider blanching it, put it in boiling water for 1 minute, take it out and rinse with cold water (to keep it crisp)
- If the dried tofu you bought is relatively hard and firm, you can also blanch it after cutting it into strips
