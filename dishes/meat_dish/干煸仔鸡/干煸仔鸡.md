## Calculation

For 1-2 people:

- Cooking wine 5g
- Starch 20g
- Pixian red oil Doubanjiang 40g
- White sugar 30g
- Crushed Sichuan peppercorns 2g

## Operation

- Debone the chicken legs (skip this step if using chicken thigh fillets), use the back of a knife to pound the chicken leg meat, and cut into 2cm pieces.
- Add salt, chicken essence (optional), pepper powder, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and cooking wine to the chicken leg meat, mix until sticky, then add starch and mix well, add cooking oil to prevent sticking, marinate for 30 minutes.
- Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2cm pieces, boil them in boiling water for 5 minutes, then remove and drain the water to prevent the pot from exploding when frying.
- Remove the seeds from the green peppers, cut them into 2cm small pieces, and place them in a colander for later use.
- Add wide oil to the pot (depending on the shape of the pot, it is enough to submerge the ingredients), when the oil temperature rises to 180℃, add the potato pieces and fry for 3 minutes, then remove.
- When the oil temperature rises to 180℃ again, add the chicken pieces and fry for 2 minutes, then remove.
- When the oil temperature rises to 180℃ again, add the chicken pieces and re-fry for 1 minute, then remove.
- When the oil temperature rises to 180℃ again, add the potato pieces and re-fry for 1 minute, then filter out the oil and potato pieces in the pot through a colander, and let the green pepper slices on the colander break raw.
- Add 5ml of cooking oil to the pot, stir-fry the garlic cloves over low heat until they turn yellow, add the red oil Doubanjiang and stir-fry until fragrant, add white sugar and stir to melt, add crushed Sichuan peppercorns, add 40ml of clear water, and stir constantly until the sauce is thick.
- Add the fried chicken pieces, potato pieces, and green pepper slices, stir well and remove from the pot.

## Additional content

- If you are reluctant to use wide oil for frying, you can use less oil to fry the chicken pieces and potato pieces. It will take longer and partially affect the taste, but it will not affect the overall taste.
