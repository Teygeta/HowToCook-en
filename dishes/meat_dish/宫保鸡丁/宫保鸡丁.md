## Operation

### Simple version

- Debone the chicken thigh with scissors, pat the chicken with the back of a knife, cut into strips and then into 1.5cm diced meat; soak in clear water for 10 minutes, take out and drain for later use (if it is chicken breast, you can directly dice and perform the subsequent actions)
- Take the green onion and 5g of ginger slices in a bowl, pour in 50g of boiling water for later use; cut the white part of the green onion into 1.5cm round pieces for later use; take the peanuts and bake them in the microwave on high heat for 5 minutes for later use
- Add 2g of salt, 5g of dark soy sauce, 15g of cooking wine, and 15g of starch to the chicken, stir well until slightly dry; slowly add some green onion and ginger water, stir the chicken until sticky; seal with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour
- Cut the dried chili into sections; heat the pot over high heat and turn to low heat; add the dried chili and bake until slightly burnt, remove and set aside; bake the Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant, remove and set aside
- Turn on high heat, pour in 20g of vegetable oil, when it is 70% hot (bamboo chopsticks bubble), add the chicken, fry until the top starts to turn white, turn it over with a spatula, stir-fry evenly after frying for 30s
- Add the green onion granules and stir-fry, add the remaining green onion and ginger water, if 100g is not enough, add a little more clear water (be sure to use hot water); cover the pot and simmer over medium-low heat for 2 minutes;
- Turn on high heat, add cooked peanuts, dried chili and Sichuan peppercorns; add 2g of chicken essence, 5g of fragrant vinegar, 2g of white sugar, stir-fry evenly;
- Add 10g of starch and 50g of clear water to make water starch, add it to the pot, stir-fry evenly, and collect the juice to the desired consistency
- Turn off the heat, drizzle in 10g of sesame oil and serve

### A slightly more complicated but more mouthwatering version

Compared with the simple version, it is more recommended to use Erjingtiao chili and raw peanuts here. And add celtuce to set off the fragrance and crispness of peanuts and the softness of chicken

- Peel the celtuce and cut it into 1cm small pieces for later use;
- Cut the Erjingtiao chili into 1cm long sections;
- Debone the chicken thigh with scissors, pat the chicken with the back of a knife, cut into strips and then into 1.5cm diced meat; soak in clear water for 10 minutes, take out and drain for later use (if it is chicken breast, you can directly dice and perform the subsequent actions);
- Take the green onion and 5g of ginger slices in a bowl, pour in 50g of boiling water for later use; cut the white part of the green onion into 1.5cm round pieces for later use
- Add 2g of salt, 5g of dark soy sauce, 15g of cooking wine, and 15g of starch to the chicken, stir well until slightly dry; slowly add some green onion and ginger water, stir the chicken until sticky; seal with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour
- Turn on medium heat, pour in 20g of vegetable oil, add raw peanuts and stir-fry until the surface is slightly charred, remove the peanuts but leave the oil in the pot;
- Continue to heat, when it is 70% hot (bamboo chopsticks bubble), add the chicken, add doubanjiang, and stir-fry for about 1 minute;
- Add the prepared celtuce cubes and continue to stir-fry for 1 minute;
- Add the green onion granules and stir-fry, add the remaining green onion and ginger water, if 100g is not enough, add a little more clear water (be sure to use hot water); add Erjingtiao chili sections; cover the pot and simmer over medium-low heat for 2 minutes;
- Turn on high heat, add the peanuts that were previously taken out and set aside, and Sichuan peppercorns; add 2g of chicken essence, 5g of fragrant vinegar, 2g of white sugar, and stir-fry evenly;
- Add 10g of starch and 50g of clear water to make water starch, add it to the pot, stir-fry evenly, and collect the juice to the desired consistency
