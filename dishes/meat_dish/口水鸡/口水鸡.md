Mouthwatering chicken (cold dish), in the hot summer, hot dishes are difficult to eat, but I am addicted to meat,
Besides mouthwatering chicken, I can't think of a better meat dish to eat in summer.
The chicken is covered in red oil, bright red and fresh, icy and Q-elastic, delicious and not greasy. It deserves to be a rice killer in summer!
