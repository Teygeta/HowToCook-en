Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Chicken drumsticks
- Dried mushrooms
- Ginger
- Scallions
- Garlic

## Calculation

Per serving:

- Chicken drumsticks 2
- Dried mushrooms 5
- Ginger 2 slices
- Scallions 2
- Garlic 2 cloves
- Warm water (30-40 ℃) 150ml
- Cooking wine 15ml
- Light soy sauce 30ml
- Salt 1.5g
- Dark soy sauce 15ml
- Sugar 15ml
- Sesame oil 5ml

## Operation

- Soak dried mushrooms in warm water
- Cut ginger into small pieces, cut scallions into sections, cut garlic in half into small pieces
- Debone the chicken drumsticks (you can also leave the bones, it just slightly affects the efficiency of the programmer's eating), cut into small pieces
- Divide the soaked mushrooms into four, keep the mushroom water for later use
- Blanch the chicken drumstick meat in water for 1 minute to remove blood and impurities
- Add 15ml cooking wine, 15ml light soy sauce, 1.5g salt, 15ml dark soy sauce to the chicken drumstick meat, mix well
- When the oil temperature is 30%, add the chicken drumstick meat and stir-fry, after the chicken drumstick meat is golden brown, take it out and set aside
- Leave the bottom oil in the pot, add scallions, ginger, and garlic to stir-fry until fragrant, add mushrooms to the pot, stir-fry evenly over high heat
- Wait for 20 seconds and the mushroom aroma will float out of the pot, then add the stir-fried chicken drumstick meat, add the mushroom water (all of it, **the soul operation in the opinion of this programmer**), 15ml sugar, 30ml light soy sauce
- Turn to medium heat, do not cover the lid, simmer for 2 minutes to thicken the soup, pour in 5ml sesame oil, sprinkle with chopped green onion, then turn off the heat and plate

## Additional content

- Deboning chicken drumsticks is more complicated, my experience is for your reference:
  - Place the chicken drumstick upright on the cutting board, with the **bone facing the programmer**, cut a knife from the head to the bottom, the cut should be deep to ensure that it touches the bone
  - Use your hands to pull the meat to both sides
  - Use the tip of a knife to separate the meat attached to the bone
  - Turn the chicken drumstick over, insert the knife close to the bone, and pick off the connection point between the bone and the meat
  - Use the tip of a knife to cut off the final adhesion
