## Operation

- Wash the bullfrog meat and drain the water, add more than 10 grams of salt and more than 50ml of beer, grab it with your hands for 5 minutes to remove the fishy smell of the bullfrog meat
- Then rinse with clean water until no more blood and impurities flow out, drain the water, put it in a suitable container, and prepare to marinate
- Add 5 grams of salt, 30 grams of cornstarch, 10ml of cooking wine, and 5 grams of pepper powder, grab it evenly with your hands, and marinate for 5-10 minutes
- Cut the pickled ginger, pickled peppers, and wild mountain peppers into shreds or slices (choose according to your knife skills), and cut the green and red peppers into circles. Just peel the garlic.
- Heat the pot until hot, add 200ml of cooking oil (you can add another 100ml if the bottom of the pot is relatively flat), heat the oil to 60% heat (small bubbles appear), pour in the marinated bullfrog and quickly fry it in oil, take it out after 10 seconds (do not exceed the time too much, otherwise it will cause the frog meat to become old and woody)
- After taking out the frog meat, drain the oil, and pour the hot oil from the pot into a bowl, leaving 30ml, add 20ml of lard (if not, keep a total of 50ml of cooking oil in the pot)
- When the oil temperature reaches 60% heat, add pickled ginger, pickled peppers, wild mountain peppers, and garlic, sauté until fragrant, add 20 grams of doubanjiang, stir-fry over medium heat until red oil comes out (control the time to 30 seconds), pour in 400ml of beer,
- Then pour in the fried bullfrog meat, push and stir with a spoon, do not stir vigorously, add 5 grams of pepper powder, add 5ml of vine pepper oil, and simmer over medium heat for 3 minutes
- Increase the heat, collect the juice over high heat for half a minute, add green and red pepper rings, cook for another 10 seconds and prepare to serve
