## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Pork ribs
- Egg
- Salt
- Pepper salt powder
- Scallion ginger water
- Flour
- Starch
- Custard powder (for color and flavor, optional)
- Water
- Oil

## Calculation

Before each production, you need to determine how many servings you plan to make. One serving is enough for 1-2 people to eat.

- Pork ribs 4 pieces (about 360 grams)
- Egg 1 50 g
- Salt 1 g
- Pepper salt powder 10 g
- Scallion ginger water 100 ml
- Flour 80 g
- Starch 80 g
- Custard powder 2-3 g (for color and flavor, optional)
- Water 10 g
- Oil 10 g

## Operation

- Wash the pork ribs, remove the bones, flatten them with the back of a knife, cut them into thick slices, and then change them into thick strips.
- Add pepper salt powder, mix well, and wait until the mixture becomes sticky. Add scallion ginger water **in batches** and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
- Make the batter. Add 80 g flour, 20 g starch (note that it is 20 g starch, and the remaining 60 g is for later use), 2-3 g custard powder, and 1 g salt.
- Add an egg, stir, then add 100 g of water in batches, and then add 10 g of oil, stirring repeatedly. Continue stirring until the batter is completely mixed and slightly viscous.
- Take out the remaining 60 g of starch, take out the pork ribs, coat them with a layer of starch, and then coat them with batter.
- Add oil to the pot, enough to submerge the ingredients, and heat to about 150 ℃ - 160 ℃. Put the pork ribs into the pot and fry until light golden brown, then remove. There may be some sticking when the pork ribs are first put in, so don't move them. After the pork ribs are set, you can use chopsticks to turn them over to separate them.
- When the oil temperature rises again to 150 ℃ - 160 ℃, put the pork ribs in and re-fry until golden brown, then remove.
- Sprinkle with pepper salt powder, mix well, and then remove from the pot.

## Additional content

- You can also use breadcrumbs instead of batter, but the taste difference is very large.
- The batter can also be used to fry chicken legs, fry fish, etc.
