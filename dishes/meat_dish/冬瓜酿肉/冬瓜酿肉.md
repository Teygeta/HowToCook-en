Per serving:

- Winter melon 200g
- Chopped green onion (one, about 20g)
- Pepper powder 5g
- Light soy sauce 10ml
- Starch 5g
- Water starch 25g (starch 25g, water 50ml)
- Minced green onion and ginger (ginger 3-4 slices about 30g, just take the white part of one of the green onions above)
- Salt 20g

## Operation

- Peel the winter melon and cut it into 25cm long and 3cm thick slices

- While letting the winter melon stand, put the minced meat, minced green onion and ginger, 5g of salt, 5g of starch, pepper powder, and light soy sauce into another bowl
- Use chopsticks to stir clockwise in the minced meat until the color of the ingredients is not obviously contrasting (about 2 minutes)
- Wash the marinated winter melon (it will become soft) three times with clean water
