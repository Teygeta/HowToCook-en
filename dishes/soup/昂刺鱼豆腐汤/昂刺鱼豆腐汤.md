## Essential Ingredients and Tools

*   Yellow catfish or sand goby
*   Tofu
*   Scallions
*   Ginger
*   Cooking oil
*   Cooking wine
*   Salt
*   Pepper

## Calculation

Per serving:

*   One yellow catfish or sand goby
*   Tofu 100 g
*   One scallion
*   One piece of ginger
*   Pepper 3-5 g
*   Cooking oil 15 ml
*   Salt 10-15 g
*   Boiling water 1L

## Operation

*   Wash the fish after processing (pay special attention to the bloodshot inside the belly; if it is not washed clean, it will have a fishy smell), put it in a large bowl, pour in cooking wine, 10g ginger slices, and 5g salt, and marinate for 15 minutes.
*   Cut the tofu into pieces, soak in cold water for 5 minutes, and remove for later use.
*   Before frying the fish, wipe the pot with ginger slices to prevent sticking. Pour in oil (the amount of oil is 15ml * the number of fish), heat it, put the fish in and fry for 2~3 minutes. During this period, you need to shake the fish to prevent sticking to the bottom, and you need to turn it over once.
*   After all the fish are fried, pour in boiling water, 5ml cooking wine, and ginger slices. Turn from low heat to high heat, cover the pot, and cook over high heat for 10 minutes (the water should be slightly more, as some will evaporate later).
*   After seeing the soup turn white, pour in the prepared tofu, adjust to medium heat and cook for another 5 minutes, add 10g salt and 3g pepper to taste, and finally sprinkle with chopped green onion before serving.
