# Pan-Fried Dumplings Recipe

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Dumplings (frozen dumplings)

## Measurements

Per serving:

- One package of dumplings (choose based on personal appetite, approximately 10 - 15 pieces)

## Instructions

- Take out a frying pan (non-stick frying pan is best).
- Add 10ml - 15ml of cooking oil.
- Turn on the heat and add the dumplings (try to spread them evenly, do not stack).
- Immediately add water, filling it to half the average height of the dumplings.
- Cover the pan (the stove should be on high heat at this time).
- Wait for 8 - 10 minutes.
- When there are only 2mm of water left in the pan, turn the heat to medium and start frying.
- Once all the water has evaporated, shake the frying pan to ensure the dumplings are heated evenly.
- Add black sesame seeds and chopped green onions, then steam for 10 seconds.
- After 1 - 2 minutes, take out one dumpling to check the bottom; if it has a golden crispy skin, remove them immediately.

## Additional Notes

- During the process, always keep an eye on the situation in the pan; do not get distracted by your phone.
