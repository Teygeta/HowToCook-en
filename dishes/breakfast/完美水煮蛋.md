The circulating boiling method developed by scientists can simultaneously achieve the effect of dense yolk, evenly solidified egg white, and retention of the most nutrients. Requires precise control of temperature and time, which is more difficult.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★★★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Fresh eggs (recommended AA grade)
- 100°C boiling water pot (diameter ≥15cm)
- 30°C warm water pot (diameter ≥15cm)
- Timer
- Colander

## Measurements

Per serving:

- 1 egg (approximately 60g)
- 1500ml of 100°C boiling water
- 1500ml of 30°C warm water

## Instructions

- Prepare two pots of water: Pot A maintains 100°C boiling water, and Pot B maintains 30°C warm water
- Use a colander to put the eggs into Pot A and start the timer
- **Precisely every 2 minutes** transfer the eggs to another pot of water
- Repeat the transfer operation for a total of 16 times (total duration of 32 minutes)
- After the last transfer, let it stand in Pot B for 30 seconds
- Immediately put it in ice water to stop heating (maintain for 30 seconds)
- When peeling, start from the blunt end air chamber and peel off the egg membrane along the longitudinal axis

## Additional Notes

- Key parameters:
  - Yolk center temperature: 67±1°C
  - Egg white layering temperature:
    - Outer layer: 100°C→87°C
    - Middle layer: 87°C→55°C
    - Inner layer: 55°C→30°C
- Nutritional advantages: 23% higher polyphenol content than traditional cooking methods
