## Instructions

### Regular Oat Cooking Method

- Pour the milk into a breakfast cup (cold is fine).
- Prepare 200ml of water; if it's drinking water, add the oats directly; otherwise, boil the water before adding the oats.
- After boiling the water for 2 minutes, the oats will be cooked.
- Remove the cooked oats and pour them into the milk (try not to pour the water used for cooking the oats into the milk, as it affects the taste).

### Quick Oat Cooking Method

- Replace regular oats with quick-cooking oats.
- Pour the milk into the container with the quick-cooking oats and stir.
- Place the mixture in the microwave.
- Microwave on medium power for 4 minutes.

### Egg Cooking Method

- Heat a pan, add a layer of oil, and fry the egg for 20 seconds on each side, considering seasoning (3g of pepper salt, optional).
- Turn off the heat and plate the egg.

The cooking process takes about 3 minutes, and the finished dish is at room temperature, making it easy to eat, generally finishing in about 2 minutes.

> 🥑 Pairing with fruits, vegetables, or soda crackers is even better.

## Additional Notes

- Due to different microwave power levels, the exact power cannot be specified.
- It is not recommended to exceed 50% of the container's capacity with the mixture, as it may overflow during heating.
- Avoid using glass cups for cooking for the same reason.
