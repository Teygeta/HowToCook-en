# American Scrambled Eggs Recipe

American scrambled eggs have a soft and tender texture. Unlike regular scrambled eggs, a small amount of milk is added to American scrambled eggs, making the egg curds finer and more uniform, and rich in nutrients.

Estimated cooking difficulty: ★★

## Essential Ingredients and Tools

- Eggs
- Whole milk/cream
- Butter
- Salt

## Measurements

Per serving:

- 3 eggs
- 10g whole milk/cream
- 5g butter
- 1g salt

## Instructions

- Crack the eggs into a large bowl, add salt, and whisk until frothy. Let it sit for 15 minutes.
- Cut the butter into small pieces and add it to the pan, then pour in the egg mixture, cooking on low heat while stirring constantly.
- Once the butter has melted, quickly stir the egg mixture, breaking it into fine curds, and turn off the heat before the eggs are fully set.
- Add the milk and stir for 15 seconds until the scrambled eggs are moist and fluffy, then plate.

## Additional Notes

- For a richer flavor, you can add sautéed diced tomatoes, onions, bacon bits, or small pieces of cheese in the last step (anything that won't release water).
- Use a frying pan (preferably non-stick).
- Consider that many people cook just one or two eggs, so a smaller pan may be more convenient for even stirring.
